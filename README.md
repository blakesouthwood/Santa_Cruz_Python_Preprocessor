# Santa_Cruz_Python_Preprocessor
Dec 28th, 2020
talk about a photo finish. Finally got javascript switch case working in python. the dream has been realized.
What a rush. Totally mind blowing. Wow.
One switch currently works. Will work on adding numbers and having several switches.
I have done nested switches working but not ready for here yet.
I did this because the Harvard Professor in CS50 said Python didn't have a switch case ... so I made one.
Updating later tonight. So cool. 
Preprocessor for Python to make code more readable, faster to write and test, fewer bugs, increase productivity
I wanted to make Python faster and easier to code and think in so I did.
Since this project has grown and will represent several cool features I'm calling
it JetPack.
