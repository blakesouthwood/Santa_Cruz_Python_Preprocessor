I figured out how I will impliment the var exp expressions at the top of a nested switch
I am in the process of making this phase reality now.

Single switches and nested switches now work inside of functions.

All switches - single and nested - running from same one method currently called two_choices()
which will become endswitch(stringname).

code music the moment switch ran inside of a function
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAObbLeRIEQ
	
Just ran a single switch inside of a function.
Will now test running a nested switch inside of a function.

Working on bug with nested switch.
The parser is moving the break from it's position to after a case block that has nested switches.
Looking at the output code generation the break is AFTER where it should be below nested switches.
So it's a logic error so I will investigate it further.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTFVdcpLrE&list=RDveHqJSC-9Lo&index=10
I made a method to allow C style comments within the switch case code input
like this  in file commenting.py
/*
comment
comment
comment
*/

// and like this

#but you can't put /* inside of code */ that has actual code on each side; can only add side comment after on right
It replaces the block of code with # on the left side of each line

Just tested newest code in Sublime Text 3 and it runs no bugs and hella fast.
I still need to do some refactoring and will cut out half of the code soon.

Figured out bug fixed it. 12:40pm Sun Feb 13, 2022
Grateful but definitely lucky through perseverance.

Found bug ( I had two conditions to determine if nested. reduced it to 1 which is if tab depth of as switch
is 3 then it's nested.
while processing elcapitan string detected that the fuzzy logic needs to be modified and I wasn't using two_choices method
	   
because it mistakenly thought that the nested switch was a single switch to fixing that now.
time 12:27pm Feb 13th, 2022  This proves the importance of continuous testing and print statements.


Feb 13th, 2022
SOLVED THE BUG - it works as designed PURE ECSTACY. WHAT A HIGH. High as a kite.
Wow. Sucker works. 

Right now it says two_choices(stringname) and I will change that to endswitch(stringname) next.
I am so thrilled that I solved it. Just fired up Visual Studio Code but realized I just needed to try what
should work and it worked. I was swapping methods around and it just messed it up and then I realized that
I need to add the key fork function in a separate file with the imported files and then import that one file
which is mocah.py and it worked - as if it was destined to work. I am speechless with happiness right now.

I will trigger this method to be done automatically next.
Right now it's forced fed with nestedswitch('True') before the function and that can be triggered
once it detects if it's either nested or not thru the endswitch beginning methods.




Feb 12th 2022 12:32 just got endswitch(stringname) to manage single and nested switches.
For testing it looks like this in alpha form.
So this means that I can use one method to call both single and nested strings and it just started working
This is a relief because it was a pain. Currently def two_choices(mystring): is in the running code file
and I will create a third import file next to put it into.
The good news is I finally solved the conflict of what was where and what was being called and when.

working on allowing C style comments // and /*  */ multiline
Works. Now refactoring the code. 


Demonstration beta of macros when,unless, until showing it's possible to add
macros and further exploration of adding more expressiveness to python to speed
up programming and increase comprehension. to avoid an uproar I showed restrating and
didn't use these macros in the implimentation of my switch case module because I didn't
want to cause any dicontent and outrage.

::IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT::

Note: Just tested it in Sublime Text 3  Build 4126   it runs.
	
files:
running_switch_case_engine.py
trex.py
official_switch_case_silver.py

				
This is the beta but it's stable now and I will now clean it up and finish the last steps to make it presentable.
This is mind blowing.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Lv5Ag5hR98
I imported the single switch engine into the file that has the nested engine imported.
Now I can "suddenly" run nested and single switches. Previously singles worked fine. Then I ran some nested
that ran fine and then afterwards a single switch and it crashed.
So I tried importing the single switch engine and it works!!!!!!

The bug from hell is solved!!!!

IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can run both nested and single switches anywhere. What a rush. Pure nirvana.

Feb  3rd 2022
Since single switch works in it's module and nested switch works in it's module I will do a diff
to determine what subtle differences exist so that I can integrate them together so that they work flawlessly.
Currently each time I combine them they fail so this way I will know how to make them coexist together
to reduce the codebase.
Uploading the working single switch engine and the nested switch engine.

Massive progress, massive momentum,tenacity, perseverance, fortitude, unstoppable.

This is a pretty song.

Merged single and nested nesteed switches together. Integrating the endswitch method to determine if nested or not
and call single switch or the bypass205. Have to go to work now so have to stop right now but added all of the code
but haven't tested it. Will figure out any issues(bugs) in this configuration since it will finally
be based on the original design of an endswitch(name) at bottom of a string and determine if it's nesteed or not
and parse it correctly. Still cleaning up the code and will likely do some refactoring. Exciting that the nested
switch functions actually work (mind boggling complexity) and single switch works. they will run independently.
What is cool is that I have proved that I can add the behavior and syntax from another programming language JavaScript, C
to Python (which is an illusion really) but it actually works. I can now impliment goto label and add macros from Lisp
when, unless, until, etc (they already work by the way)

Feeling good.

I can at will run a single switch caseand a nested switch case togethe in a sequence  in the same file.
My sensor fuzzy logic works. So I am now running single switches and nested switches in the same file.
Pure nirvana. This morning I hoped but i wondered if it would work. I made a flag and next I will add
my code to determine if it's a nested or single switch. Quite thrilling actually.

Working on getting single switch and nested switch to work together independently in same file today.



January 31st, 2022 time 5:17pm 
Took out a great deal of the print statements.
uploaded lastest files:  make_it_so.py and site_b.py (the nested switch module)

The big news is that the module for nested switches works and doesn't need to ever reload.
Still working on refining it but it works so I essentially climbed El Capitan at Yosemite National Park in a blizzard to get it working.
That was a massive accomplishment. And any number of nested switches can be used.
If the reader is curious how this *magic* works it's just a PARSER and CODEGENERATOR (I designed and wrote both)
I did look in the blue dragon book but did it all from my design - that parses JavaScript switch cases
and converts it into python code. Each nested switch is put into a function that is the trick. The other issue is that
Python is quite militant about indentation and tabs so I hemmed and hawwed and chose to use tabs for determining
the location and count of nested switches. Each NESTED switch is indented 3 tabs. So the JavaScript/C switch case
behavior is mimicked but sadly Python actually doesn't have these REALLY COOL switch case RUNNING BEHAVIORS so
I figured out how they would work. So using sly and clever Python code the EXPECTED JAVASCRIPT/C SWITCH CASE BEHAVIORS
ARE REALIZED - though it's all an illusion. But I started thinking what else is done in C with switch case.
Macros. So I figured out how to do macros (hella tricky) but they work. I created to and thru macros to do a series
of numbers in cases. I was reading through the Yale University C style guide and the prof did tumbling math so 
I added an add() method and it can be duplicated to do multiplication and whatever else the developer wants
but I did add() for now that works like a fallthru.
The initial idea was to copy and paste JavaScript switch case code and it would work in Python. That is still the goal.
The issue is that for it to work the switch case needs to be built using tabs.

commented out overflow_manager_quail() 
and 
overflow_manager_stanford() 
not needed now.

Taking out print statements from program.
Still need to add the var exp inputs at top of switch at top (working) not implimented in this yet.
##=======================================================================================



Finally sucker works for nested any number. I just ran it in sublime text 3 it worked.
I will quickly modify it to work like the single switch case so that the programmer/developer
has endswitch(stringname) at the bottom so it's called automatically.
I was using mission_control_sequence(num,inputstring) for testing purposes only.
So just relax and chill. And I will condense the code and document it more.

I am pretty dam stubborn which helps. I feel weightless and like I'm flying through the clouds now.
I'm extremely persistent. Again I will take out the thousands of print statements and clean up the code in the next
two weeks. Happy happy, joy joy.
Why did I tackle making a JavaScript/C switch case that has macros work in Python?
Because I read that biologists were using Python and I figured they would like to have a JavaScript/C switch case to use
in Python, now they can.

January 30th, 2022 . I had a bad function messing everything up. 
#take_out_extraneous_white_spaces_on_the_left_of_each_line()
it's commented out for now. I just need to take out the print statements now.
I just tested 11 nested switches in a sequence worked.

files are make_it_so.py and site_b.py
Next I will test single switches with it intermixed with nested to see how it goes.

january 27th, 2022 9:30am
4 nested switches just ran now in a sequence
taking out print statements and cleaning up the code.
Will test this engine with single switch string next which should work
Will reduce some functions down into smaller methods to streamline it.

jan 26th 2022 7:01 pm  Will upload code within an hour
tested 3 nested switch cases (separate nested switches)
Has a bug (though works). Working on bug will but will upload it since it does technically work.
I am working on a work around for the bug currently.

By the way I zerod in and found thse bugs using print statements and NOT with VSC or Spyder or PyDev
Isolated 2 bugs and now infinite nested switches will work.
quail list bug had residue of previous nested switch pass
stanford list had resideue of previous nested switch pass
Put in temp fix for both bugs to ensure there were no more bugs.
Temp fix works voodoo programming fix and will replace with granite fuzzy logic.

Looking at source of bug that is doing an overflow residue from first nested switch into second nested switch.
Using Visual Studio Code and Spyder in Anaconda.
Stepping thru the code. Need bigger screen. Dam. But at least now I can see it misbehave and 
zero on fixing it. Next two days off from work so I can solve it tuesday and wednesday. 
Everything is the process of elimination.



January 19th, 2022 8:33am PST nested module works. Cleaning it up so that I can do multipe nested switches
by clearing out the lists and vars after completing a nested switch generation.
First successful run with the module was at 3pm yesterday.

No WAY. TOTAL SHOCK. It works.  tahoe_dream1_working_bliss.py # does nested switching
I need to add reset to it next which would empty the lists and vars.

I can call it from the bottom so I can do endswitch now.
I was thinking about it yesterday and put my first_module just above bypass205() and that did the trick.
Tested it in BBEdit, Sublime Text 3, Visual Studio Code. Works in all of them.
Uploading it. I am about to test different switch strings now. I am shaking with disbelief right now.

Taking out duplicate functions
I managed to connect stage 2 and stage 3 together successfully and about to add stage 1 directly
in front of stage 2 so that I can call the nested switch module thru a main at the bottom
simulating the endswitch()
It's been a good boxing fight. Isolated module 1 and taking out print statements right now and then will
add it  and call it directly before bypass205() in the main at the bottom of the file so it will stop crashing.


jan 16th saturday 2022 8;52 am
pinpointed bug!!! so happy



Was flailing then then had a thought and it worked.
I had a function that had to be called where it was located otherwise it wouldn't work.
I was at my wits end to solve the problem. Then I thought what if I dynamically called the function
with differnet inputs, (number or word and string name) at first with eval and then without eval.
The issue was I need to have a nested switch called with an endswitch(stringname) at the bottom
of a nested switch to trigger the nested switch code.
But whenever I moved the trigger method mission_control it wouldn't work and it got scary.
the hard coded method would only work correctly where it was and also the bypass205() nethod
is hard coded and the bottom_sequence() at the bottom.
The only change occurring when I called the module are the input number or word and the stringname.
So I realized what if I dyanmically call the mission_control method without moving it since its hardwired.
and I need to call it automatically which means it's always on. It's the trigger for the first section of the 
translation of the input switch into python code parsing and generating python and conccatting it.
This whole module will be in the background imported and everything can happen in the background but I was in  tizzy
over being able to call it multiple times. Running once it's fine. And now it should work multiple times.
More testing tomorrow.

I had hit a wall and my unconscious solved it. This is soooo awesome.

for testing I am calling it mrendswitch(string) 

##====== javascript hack trick ===
variableinput=[]
variableinput.append(0)
stringlist=[]
stringlist.append(0)
##==========================================
variableinput[0]= 1
#stringlist[0] = red_robin

#this grabs the switch string name as input  and puts it into list stringlist[0]
##=========================
def mrendswitch(string): #this would run above in the file  <<====endswitch(stringname) will be in other file
    print("=== mrendswitch called ====")    #everything in *this* file is invisible will be imported
    stringlist[0]=string
    print(stringlist[0])
    stringname =stringlist[0]

mrendswitch(red_robin) #this is called and triggeres filling the two lists
##missioncontrol is called 
#stringlist[0] =stringname #from above   THIS IS NOW DYNAMIC JAN 13, 2022 but doesn't move
anumber = variableinput[0]  #I can change the inputs with changing what is in the lists it reads
stringname=red_robin        #I will fill the lists with the endwitch call

mission_control(anumber,stringname)  #this function must stay RIGHT HERE 

#exec(sweet)
#it did say missioncontrol(1,redrobin) #this was hardcoded for testing
#===============
#what if I dynamically change it

My code was one module and to work I need to call it from the bottom (or so I thought).
I couldn't move the mission_control() method trigger because it wouldn't work right and I didn't want to spend
two weeks refactoring all the code. Then I thought of JavaScript and thought, hey what if...
I dynamically build the called trigger method and fill it and it ran. I am blown away that it worked.
So I couldn't move the trigger method otherwise I got all kinds of list errors and nothing worked.
So I was splitting up the huge module into 4 smaller modules and I couldn't call the trigger at the bottom.
I then thought what if I dynamically fill the trigger method and. it worked. wow. Blew my mind.
SO HAPPY.So, this means I can can call the working nested switch code with an endswitch() and it should work.
endswitch is a method that holds a string which is the nested switch input
endswitch will pass the string name into a field (a list) and the input value such as 1 is in another list
above each switch. The issue is calling the switch once is fine. But it is not possible (right now) to call another one.
Now it should call any number of nested switches. Like all of my brilliance it came to me in a flash of insight just now.

seperated monster file into 4 separate modules which will be accessed by one file
and this way I can control the vars and lists and thus clear them after each run (hopefully)
which is how the single switch works.
I will make the first attempt today. I have the code in 4 parts now and I'm testing and
verifying each seperated module works independently and then I will import the output lists
from each from a main file. The point of this design change is to be able to call nested switches
any time and do many like I do with single switches. The problem was resetting it since it's a massive
file and unwieldy and I need to clear the lists and vars. So I have each module feed it's output
as input into the next module below it with the main function in the top file.
taking out all of the prints I used for debugging. I will first test and verify each separate
module still works after cutting them apart.
This will eventually be triggered by endswitch(stringname) at the bottom of a C style switch doc string.

Jan 10th, 2022 3:23 pm
Designing a main for nested switches
with methods in order within it to fix bug preventing from doing many nested switches
since right now it's not currently in a true sequence. This should make it behave and work properly.
I went on a drive today and the obvious solution occurred to me . 
Just like in the single switch I use a main sequence for the complicated methodical steps.
It's so obvious to me now. I got a posterboard this morning to flow chart the sequence and that
got me thinking of a simpler and more elegant solution.

Jan 8th, 2022 9;23 am
organzing and modularing the nested switch engine so that I can do multiple nested switch strings
in a sequence just as I can with single switches. Still speechless nested switch works.
The ordering of the mini modules is crucial to avoid having to do a reload so clearing the lists
and vars is imperative. So right now dealing with the organization of the flow of control
and cutting up sections into separate modules so I can eventually but it all into one file for simplicity
flowing top down .


just checked and both scenarios switch and nested switches work in Sublime Text.
wed jan 5, 2022 7;36 pm.
currently I can run n number of single swtiches no probs
when I run more than 1 nested switch it crashes so I am working on clearing out the vars and lists states to virgin state
just like I did (apparently properly) in the single switch scenario and I will incorporate that into the much more complex
nested switch.
The single switch is lightning fast. The nested switch has a ton of print statements which I'm quickly commenting out
to make it faster.

Also the code size will be drammatically reduced so as to reuse the same single switch parser and codegen that I am using for the single
switch scenario. I currentlly have a modified and greatly added onto parser and code gen engine for the nested switch
behavior generator. Thrilled to death that it works though. Mind blowing complexity. 

I am still in total shock it works. It was mind bending to solve it and impliment my design.
The design was the key to success.

just reviewed how I cleared out the vars and lists for the single switch which I call 15 times
in the beta demo I finished in June and now I will use the same technique for the nested switches
so that a series of nesteed switches can be used.

The nested switch is a beast for it's codegen tricks and I apprently wasn't clearling each list and var just in time
so I will work on that engineering tomorrow.

Next after that I will activate the bypass205() method so that if at least one nested switch is detected
in a switch string it will do the nested_switch scenario otherwise it will do the one switch scenario.

Releasing Beta in a few days of switch and nested switch module with specs and tutorial how to use.

Still trying to figure out how to get nested switch to work as a module.
I did combine the imported file to the main module is now inside of the main module so it doesn't have to be imported.
Nested switches works but hasn't been added to the regular switch as yet.
I am currently using the Spyder debugger to step thru my code to figure out why it is getting hung up in the concat stage.

I have one nested switch working and I am having trouble getting it to work when importing the file and  using a nesetd switch
and running it from the imported file.
It works fine in the same file. That's the only issue I have right now. 
With solitary switches with no nested switches that engine works fine importing the file. 
My nested switch works now but I import it and run it but it crashes at the concat stage trying to zero in on the bug.



11:09 am Fri Dec 31st, 2021 TOTALLY WORKS. PURE NIRVANA . crushed the bugs.This is the first time it ran all the way through.
I decided to reduce the test code to one main switch and one nested inner switch to reduce the problem set. Solved it.
# radical list is a copy of the quail output list in starship
# switch_numbers_to_transfer are actually the switch numbers which are the line numbers of each switch

# this list is utilized to number the switches after going thru the parser and codegen to be added as a comment
# which earlier were grabbed from the switch number comments after each switch in the quail list which is an entirely
# different animal then the stanford list. The quail list is the input string and it's various tranformations prepping
# before being fed to bypass205 where it is converted into python code. The generated python code representation of the
# switch strings is deposited into the stanford list.

Friday, Dec 31 new year's eve, 2021 9:40 am 

on home stretch to home plate. dec 31st Friday. Working on last critical bug.
Good music capturing the moment of anticipation.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsTFVdcpLrE&list=RDsRvEwXDxz_I&index=10
	
The bug is when I run the methods that split up the input nested switch and chops it up into individual switches
and analyzes the data specifics and runs the chain methods on the individual switches to prepare them for the parser
and puts them back into the quail list it doesn't run. But my test code runs.
So paired down the 8 nested switches down to 2 switches to narrow down the scope of the bugs behavior to localize it.




wed dec 29th, 2021  11:36pm
Figured out the trick to import a file, run code in it, and fill a list from the imported resulting list.
So now I can finish rudolph file that will do everything for nested switches.
more testing tomorrow. What I did is call the starship file which splits up the nested switch string
and then runs each switch string thru the chain methods and fills the quail list. 
So that just worked. Great relief. I will have rudolph file (soon be nested_module) should be fully (finally)
working tomorrow. Greatly relieved I figured it out with trail and error.
Moving forward now.



Approaching the finish line.
Had one slight problem. I couldn't locate my single switch working code. then... I got lucky and found it
thanks to a github backup back in June I believe. This was a monumental relief because I couldn't find it amongst all of my backups.
Single switch (the originals) with switch module and test file
single_switch_core.py  and single_switch_beta_testing.py test single switch code
just uploaded both of these to github

time for music to celebrate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDWFVI8PQOI&list=RD63088Hhjexg&index=6  Rhythm is a dancer
My test does 15 single switch case strings individually using macros, numbers and UPPERCASE words and words in strings.
I will reupload them as a backup again, because they were difficult to find but I will rename them.

I will do testing of single switches and nested switches back to back and verify all is well.

When my code works it feels like this: F16 smoke on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGDsooClz0k
		
		
Down to just two files now to make nested switches work.
I have starship which does the prepping of the input string for the parser is now in one file.
And rudolph is the nested switch engine(code name of course obviously) and they are not connected yet.
For maintenance I will likely just import Starship into Rudolph to reduce the complexity and make maintenance less
of a heartache.
Before uploading the two files to github I tested them and they both work. I was breathless when they ran perfectly.
Perseverance wears the crown.

Big rush of adrenaline when I reduced booster 1 and 2 into one file Starship. That was a pain due to dependencies.
####==================================================================
Uploaded rudolph.py and starship.py to github for safety in case my laptop dies after accidently spiling mocha all over it
in late night coding session. Still plugging away though.

I can do anything with code.

Currently playing with switch(true) but will figure it out later, no time right now
	
I have been reducing down the two last two minimodules that I am adding to the working code
1) get switch pairs and separate input strings into a list
2) chain methods converting each string for parser converting input prepped strings into python output numbered methods
3) run thru bypass205 concat output strings and execute code

Adding these two chunk to seperate input strings from initial string.

I can now have (after testing it) input vars at top of switch case that 
are mapped to each nested switch input.
example:
	
	Nested-Switch Statement:

Nested-Switch statements refers to Switch statements inside of another Switch Statements.

Syntax:

switch(n)
{
  // code to be executed if n = 1;
  case 1: 
    
  // Nested switch
  switch(num) 
  {
    // code to be executed if num = 10
    case 10: 
      statement 1;
      break;
      
    // code to be executed if num = 20
    case 20: 
      statement 2;
      break;
      
    // code to be executed if num = 30
    case 30: 
      statement 3;
      break;
      
      // code to be executed if num 
      // doesn't match any cases
      default: 
  }
  
  
  break;
    
  // code to be executed if n = 2;
  case 2:
    statement 2;
    break;
  
  // code to be executed if n = 3;
  case 3: 
    statement 3;
    break;
  
   // code to be executed if n doesn't match any cases
   default: 
}
Example:


// Following is a simple program to demonstrate
// syntax of Nested Switch Statements.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nested-switch-case/
#include <stdio.h>
  
int main()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;  #<<========== this is what I am talking about implimenting right now, vars above switch
  
    // Outer Switch
    switch (x) {       #<<============== var x here inside of switch as param
  
    // If x == 1
    case 1:
  
        // Nested Switch
  
        switch (y) {    #<<=========== var y here inside of switch as param
  
        // If y == 2
        case 2:
            printf( "Choice is 2");
            break;
  
        // If y == 3
        case 3:
            printf( "Choice is 3");
            break;
        }
        break;
  
    // If x == 4
    case 4:
        printf( "Choice is 4");
        break;
  
    // If x == 5
    case 5:
        printf( "Choice is 5");
        break;
  
    default:
        printf( "Choice is other than 1, 2 3, 4, or 5");
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}



var1 = 'fun", var2= 'jazz', var3 = 'dino', var4 = 'trouble'
#these are put into a list in sequential order from left to right like the American number line
varholder[0] = var1

#it would be implimented after the code is generated and replace the switch(exp) based on location with varname

I have the code for nested switches in one file module now
I am slowly hooking the pieces together.
I am testing each section independently from the running code as I gradually connect each piece together.
I have canned hard coded data that works and now I am replacing each section with the running code
by turning on each new module which are each running independently (outside realm of actual code) so in parallel,
for testing purposes for quality control.
So I am slowly cascading down works tip toeing down thru the flow of control. 

Dec 21st, 2021 8:17 am PST Morgan Hill, California

About to connect the two last pieces together.

I have been diligently testing the generated python (which works) and concatting it and executing it with exec(string)
and it works. I am speechless to have made it to this juncture. The rush is overwhelming.

I was setting the exp='word'  or exp='3' for the nested switches and have been researching how C style guide at Yale
and elsewhere describe the convention for setting vars for inputs of nested switches which is new to me so I will
incorporate that feature in a few days utilizing a list.

For nested switches the convention is apparently to set the vars for the nested switches above the entire nested switch case.
The way I was implimenting it (which will still work) is setting the vars for switch input params just above
each nested switch. 
a = '100', b = '200'
switch(a)
     switch(b)
	
Refactoring. Connecting it all together.
Trapeze act next connecting the two pieces now.

#these two sections do these behaviors representing the FIRST HALF of the mission
1 Scan thru the input nested switch string and get the switch and endswitch locations and build pairs 
predicated on the tab count and proximity of the switch and endswitch neighboring proximity.

2 Copy the switch body strings based on the switch/endswitch pairs
and put each of these switch bodies into a list

##===============================================
These two behaviors 1 and 2 now work together.

#input and output of what these two puzzle pieces do:
github messes it up so it's closer to the left margin than how it's portrayed and displayed here which is misleading..

===========
the switch strings cut up are now printed out top down
								
The top half will fill the columbia_river list which is then fed into the quail list which runs thru bypass205()

The other half of the nested switch module is connecting this top half (above) to the rest of the nested project which takes these input strings
and runs each switch string thru the chain methods and then they are put into the quail list
and fed into bypass205() which then converts them from JavaScript into Python and finally executes the 
resulting concatted string after having converted each switch body into a unique method numbered.

switch case strings for each switch case body.

finaloutput.append(0) #creates slot
'''
this cleans up input javascript code that is supposed to be 
governed by tabs in front ala Python and if a space is discovered
it is neutralized and deleted. 
This first counts the tabs in each line in the string.
second it cuts out all spaces and tabs from left of each line
then it concats a new string with the correct tab count in
front of each line so it's CLEANED UP essentially.

What I worked on yesterday was generating the nested switch and running it from input strings of Javascript/C switch cases already split up
Today I found the code that creates the split separated input switch strings that are fed into quail.
I also just refactored a remove junk spaces from input strings to prevent disaster.
I still need to wire it all together (it has been joined in the past) and all should go well.

Need to work on some modifications in the generated code so that the nested switches get the proper input which was 
an earlier (past) but preventing the triggering of the nested switches.



#this will be renamed but is for testing.
the actual code is triggered by endswitch(string) at bottom of switch case.

but for testing it looks like this:
topvalue[0]='1' #input value for top of switch(x)
clever_cat() #this triggers the switch case parser and code gen concat generated strings and exec(code)

As I just discussed with my brother, what just saved this project from failure was building it in sections and then
at the very end (the past month) I broke the project into two pieces that I worked on seperately. The end game plan
was to verify that the main bypass engine was working and that the code ran. The other part was concatting the strings together
accurately and then making sure that the generated code executed. I was watching Super Heavy Booster and Starship before they
were stacked and it gave me the idea to split the project at the end to make sure the two critical pieces work independently.

I failed when I made the frosty.py file that imported the files and I had to import lists and it was a mess. My mind set was
similar to a web app and it was not working properly so I restarted and then cut out the tron3 file to focus on concatting and
execu(code) seperately since the bugs were coming fast and furious which was raising my frustartion level and as I continued
to flail I decided to utilize divide and conquoer and finally I broke through and got it working. It was impossible to debug
altogether because I didn't know how to pinpoint the bugs and zero in on them. I then compared what was working
and gradually figured out the bugs with test code what was running and where it wasn't properly calling nested switches.

It was just last night that it started beginning working properly(as seperate parts individually) 
in the three piece set of mini modules all together in one file. And the starship section that concats worked after I solved
a string bug. And then I was able to successfully test the three module section with bypass that started with input
in the quail list of the seperated switch strings rather then starting with one big string and seperating it which already works.


#=========================================================================
Next I will test some javascript and C switch cases and make sure that this new python switch case
exhibits the identical running behavior of C and Javascript switch cases. I will get the C and JavaScript examples
off the web to avoid any bias. 

I will also add the free floating default from C (likely next week as side project) where default can be located anywhere within a switch case and not
necessarily at the bottom. Though for implimentation that is where the default ends up after parsing.

Nested Switch works and runs thru bypass205().
Pure nirvana. All of the hardship to get it working is over with.
Disbelief. Fixed bug last night that held me up. As Alan Turning described bugs as snags - it's true.
Total dream seeing it working.
Will upload later tomorrow evening.

I just uploaded the critical files for the automated nested switching to work.

Nested switches took 6 months. First I modified the parser to handle (it's a tricky detour)
more than one input switch case string. I collect them in a list called quail (whom never travel alone)
then loop thru the quail list and use bypass205() to convert each string into python which is placed into the stanford list
The actual bypass205() design is utter genius that evolved over time to become extremely svelt. 

#inside of endswitch()  #an inner chunk of the critical code 
	print("length of quail =",len(quail))             #3
	print("number endswitches =",endswitch_number)    #2

I am now working on trapeze which takes in a raw string of switch case for input which is governed by tabs
for the switch to work. Currently I am using a canned switch case string to test. So it will fully work
connected together likely tomorrow. Right now it works just fine with the test code switch case for input.
Also, take note that the input string is run thru bypass205() and I still need to activate it by going thru
the regular parser which then in turn triggers bypass205() officially so I need to test that phase too.
The reality is that the impossible parts are working now and the cakewalk part that remains is trivial.
Just getting exec(code) to work within a function was a total nightmare journey through hell.
Never used extensive imported files and lists before this project and that thankfully went smoothly.

In the past python code I wrote in BBedit had difficulty running in Sublime but for this project
the code runs perfectly in Sublime Text 3 build 4121.

nested switches works. total disbelief.
Will upload code and begin cleaning it up. I stopped breathing when it ran. I thought there was some mistake.
Music playing when it first worked altogether.

Thursday, DEc 9th, 2021 10:03 pm PST California.
Just successfully tested 4 level deep nested switch in Python.
This was code parsed, generarated and concatted together and executed.
There are three pieces of the puzzle and I am in the process of connecting them together.
I am combining sets of the methods to help manage the code for inevitable refracturing later.

concatting the code has three sections

# =======  switch  =================================
def switch(x):
	#if type(x) != str:  #checks to make sure it's a string if for example a number is passed as x
	#	x = str(x)
	global case
	case = x.lower() 
# =======  fallthru       =========================
def fallthru(y):
	eval("switch('" + y + "')")
#==================

It's a dream come true. Testing right now and this is the first run testing jumping around.

testing concatting the strings together.
When the code runs it does it's calculations but it's in a balloon in a combined string.
I added a feature to get the output result from anywhere in the switch case which would
be outside of the dynamically created switch case. Right now it's in result[0].
I will have a list with many slots to grab whatever data. I will dynamically have it fill
lists to make the results of a switch case malable outside the word of the dyanmic switch case.

going through the special parser for nested switches
this is how it looks at the next stage after I add the switch line numbers as comments after top switch
This is the result of codegen() which is (at this stage) the same codegen uses for single switches.
So this is the resulting python generation to create the same identical behavior in a C/JavaScript switch case.

Nested Switch cases works.


Monday, dec 6th, 2021 6:36 pm
Chain methods finally work correctly. The chaining was no big deal it was getting the methods to behave correctly.
I can now feed the list of prepped strings to bypass205() to run thru the parser.
I already made the framing for the python output so the completion could possibly happen tomorrow.
The example uses a triple nested switch and it looks identical to if it were written in C or JavaScript
with C's behavior and look and feel using braces. I use an endswitch at the bottom of each switch though.
Though going thru the parser it is converted into a closing brace. I had some issues with the chaining but that
was only due to bugs in the methods. This was quite frustrating but I overcame it.

For testing I did all seven input strings as  list thru the first method and then waterfalled it feeding
it into the second method creating a list then the third method. After more testing I will most likely
modify it to do each method in a sequence on one string which was the original idea (for coolness). However,
I did it this way in phases to test it to make sure that it was working correctly.
I am so happy. My goal is to finish and document the program before christmas. I hope to do some test runs thru
bypass205 tomorrow. I already ran three strings the other day. The bypass parser is identical to the regular one switch 
parser but it puts the output into a list instead of executing it.

Truth be told I will have a goto label working likely by Christmas. The way it works is 
underneath it works on top of the switch case I just built.

I have been messing around with when, until, unless, and loop too. The whole project has been a test of my fortitude
and endurance. This is by far the most complex program I've ever written.

Reviewing test output code that I wrote back in June and July this year.
I once worked with a guy at Fry's from Pakistan and he told me some powerful words once.
Proper planning prevents poor performance. I took those words to heart and designed the end game to make sure
that the solution would work. That working prototype fueled me with hope till the very end.
I am really glad that I thought out and made the prototpye of finished output code that I could work towards.
This code has working example of the generated python code and how it will work. I am playing with this code
right now and it's like reaching the top of El Capitan. It's the end goal and it's so simple yet compicated and
yet it works. It's all about the design and engineering simplicity to do complex behaviors.
The rush I feel right now seeing the end goal and how close I am is hard to fathom. It is like seeing a dream
materialize before my eyes that seemed utterly unattainable. I also saved in these test files the modifications to the
generated code that I need to finish the project.

Today is a happy day!

I think that the nested switch case feature will be working in a few days, a week at the most.
Everything part is working right now.

The crux of the problem is managing the switches at different tab locations.


First I need to get the pair ranges for where each switch  to endswitch lives called a pair.
Then I copy the string from within those two inputs and put that concatted string into a list.
This is seen below. The next phase is what I have been working on diligently for months to 
transform the separated switches into individual switchs and the inner switches within each (if they have any)
into methods that are numbered by their original line number which is tagged to each switch with a following comment.

  		case 1 thru 3:

What I worked on yesterday and today was the chain methods to prepare a switch string with nested switches
into separate switch strings. This is managed by dealing with each switch at 1 tab indentation and
the inner switches at 3 tabs indentation. There is a lot going on but the design engineering happened back in July
and the implimentation was quite tricky. But I tested what the output would be before proceeding with the code.
I am happy to report that the transformation stage is working and I can now send it to the parser.

The chain methods transforms the switch string into this output in a list.
Not all nested strings will have nested strings with them which I dealt with today.
				
Not shown here but the indentation level on the left before the switch is just 1 tab. so this makes it look off.
Notice the inner switches are now numbered nested_switch methods

##=========
Tuesday, November 30th, 2021  2:10 PM PST Hollister,California Starbucks.
Previous version of indenting to left works without errors after extensive testing.

Fixed bug in cutting out body of inner switches. 
I can now run chain_methods on each string to prepare each of the input switch strings for bypass205().
This section started back in August. It's the last day of November and with persaverance I got it working.
Relieved. 

separating the switch strings from the main initial switch with nested switches here

Tron Rises. Sat Nov 27th, 2021 5:19pm
Finally got taking out inner switch bodies at 3 tabs working. 
Now I will test changing to nested_switch method numbered . What an ordeal to get it stable. Works now.

Testing the chains methods thoroughly and chaining them together today.
They are each verified to be correct for all scenarios.
Total rush seeing it all come together.
This section deals with setting up the input switch strings for the parser bypass205() to handle a switch
with unknown numbers of nested switches initially at unknown depths until they are analyzed.

9:26 am PST testing piping between chain methods now.
	
Piping works. Nov 20th, 2021  11:00am PST So chaining methods works. This means feeding the output from a method
as input for the next method in a chain (a line of methods).

Saturday, Nov 20th, 2021  9:06 am
Last major chain method confirmed working!

Flow Zone Trance concentration music:

I will now pipe the methods together and apply them to each input string in list.
The rest is gravy and simple to impliment. Likely tomorrow morning the pre-parser code will be golden.
The half after the parser dealing with the python code is simple to put together with the methods already working.
INPUT sample strings looked like this:
		switch(exp) #11

Fri Nov 19th, 2021
Utter disbelief. Just fixed some code and got more working.
Adding working functionality on the fly to chain methods
shift to left works
cut out inner switch bodies works
both on the fly applied to a list.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I22AqV9zV50   Tron music - pretty dam good.
getting cutting out the inner switch bodies had some simple but slightly perplexing logic bugs but
I ironed them out.

The rush is phenomenal seeing the nested switch starting to come to life. It's alive!

the first two methods were challenging. The second one was a real mother of a bitch. I just kept breaking
the code down to smaller methods to manage the complexity.

three more methods to go for chain methods. They work. Just making them work on their own now with no help.

#output looping thru list

now big test of second chain method #taking out switch bodies
this should print out 6 stritngs

What this does is prep the string before it is fed into bypass205() which calls the parser individually
for each input switch string.
I already tested and verified that my pair list of switch endswitches works and that 
a list made up of the pairs is correct.

Testing chain methods individually then will test as a chain using piping now called do_pipe()
All of the methods in chain methods now verified to work.
do_pipe() works. Note. Python has a pipe() method for the os therefore I changed my pipe name to do_pipe().
Will next test chain_methods() together with all cylinders running. time 9:40 am. Nov 15th
	
	
Afterwards I will then work on post parser on python switch stings output combining.

== Method Chaining ==
# I knew that Ruby had method chaining and thought it would be cool if Python could do chaining.
# of course it uses a some fancy code but it will work. It's a matter of how its implimented.
indent_to_left.add_comment_to_switch.cut_out_switch_bodies.swap_switch_with_nest_method.add_brace()
# it will be implimented like this:
method_chaining("method1.method2.method3.method4.method5()") #only way I can get away with using dots(.)
# put into a list in the same order as in the argument param
# it is fed the starting var data in list input[0]
# and the resulting result string is in  output[0]

I was thinking about applying each method individually to the list and looping thru 
it and thought that was inefficient and wondered if there was a way to simulate chaining to 
get the same effect and gain the efficiency and elegance of doing a chain of methods and 
just how it would work and be possible to impliment. 

Late last night an idea popped into my head and I quickly figured out how to make it work.
Chaining methods. For the pre-parser I need to call up to ten methods that are applied individually
to each string and that would have meant looping through all of the strings in a  list each time.
With this solution I just do one loop and apply the method chain to each string just once.
Wrote code at midnight last night and will test it today.

  output[0] = method4(input[0]);feed_data()
  output[0] = method5(input[0]) 

	
#Result in output[0]
Indent to left margine
Add comment to switch
Cut out switch body at 3 tabs deoth
Swap switch with nested switch
Replace bottom endswitch with brace

Each method stage all five in sequence to a string

Chain the methods output to list[0]
Then that list is input to next method
Input[0] string method name
Put change into output[0]
Transfer then input[0] = output[0]

coding music today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckmh6FvHidQ
		
I need to loop thru the quail string list of nested switches and take out the inner switch bodies
and then replace the switch word that is an inner switch with a nested_method numbered.

Almost forgot. Found my code to indent initial switch strings that are deeply indented and reduces the
tab count so it is aligned correctly to the left margine with the proper indentation.

	
There are two phases involved here. The preparation of a switch string before it goes into bypass205
and secondly taking the output python generated code (for each switch string) from the parser and
combining them together for a switch with nested switches which is then finally executed.
First half is modifying the input JavaScript style switch string and preparing it for the parser.
Second half is adding elements to the output python switches strings and combining them.
I had to break the problem in half to manage the complexity. The first half I thought would take a week.
It has taken three months but I solved it so I am nonetheless still ecstatically happy.
The second half is super easy and works. I have done extensive testing of how and what the code will do
so I am 100 percent confident it will all work. The speed bumps have been the limitations of Python so I 
have been making methods to simplify the obfuscated nature and bizzare way that python does things.

Full steam ahead dash to the finish line in 5th gear.
Working on the transformation of the output python switch code which is a while True loop with ifs.
Reviewed my code and found and then rewrote code to add  "def nested_switch + number + (exp)" on top of
output python switch code. I then modified get number after inswitch() after # . That works smoothly now.

I still have a few more items to modify the switchcode to prepare it before it goes into the parser.
in quail list of separated string things to do (steps)
have to replace inner switches (cut out inner switch bodies leaving just switch word)
get number from  comment after switch of line number (that works)
Need to replace inner switch word with nested_switch method + number
take out excess tabs in front of switch cases so it's uniform
Have to make the main switch string with nested switches at 3 tabs replaced by methods

In review the parser is designed to do only one switch string and convert it into python representation.
Therefore I use a special extension called bypass205 that does any number of inputs switch strings
in a list and fills the stanford list but does not execute the code. They are each managed separately.

##======================================================================================================

Nested switches (that look just like C switch cases ... will be working by 
this weekend and the whole modules for switch and nested switch
will be on github. It's been a wild ride. What a roller coaster. So much logic. 

Massive momentum today after solving bugs late last night till midnight to outthink Python's peculiarities.
Super progress this morning got me over the hump and now I am going full speed ahead.

I will start sending the seperated strings to the parser in bypass205 likely tomorrow. What a rush. I am so thrilled
by my recent progress.

What a rush. By the way it also takes out braces if they exist. Next I will loop thru the list of seperated strings and apply this to each switch string
that has more than one switch within it meaning at least 1 switch. So it will test for if string.count("switch") >= 2 and string.count("endswitch") > 1
swap inner switches to methods works automatically for all switches at 3 tabs length in a string.
I wrote it on halloween and just retested it.

Yes, I know wait what about the input for (exp) for each switch. I will add that line above later. it's trivial.

Code to do the magic.

Cutting out inner switch bodies at 3 tabs works on-the-fly automatically. sweet. 
This is yet another victory in the tranformation of the input switch code to prepare it for the parser.
Next I will swap out the inner remaining inner switch words with a nested_switch numbered.
This morning had some weird bugs and they were only rectified by using listname.clear() 
The method loops thru a list of the strings which are in a list of the separated switch strings.
#I will beautify the code later. Just getting it all working right now.

PUtting code up on github in case my laptop dies. As an emergency backup.
Lots of files. Code nearly done, days away, but I don't want to risk losing it if my laptop crashes.

Gaining Steam and accelerating. I now have momentum and it feels great seeing it reach completion.
I have the following working and connected.
Go thru input multi switch string
make pairs list of switch and endswitches by tab depth
add sublists together for one list of switch, endswitch pairs
separate switch strings using pairlist and put nested string into a list

if a switch string has a nested switches at three tab depth then reduce switch bodies to just switch word.
Next I will add the methods to replace inner switch with nested_switch_numbered making it into a method.
This now works using fuzzy logic and can deal will multiple inner switches. I used my macro trick
and change the string from bottom up so that the pair numbers are still valid that I used to access the string.

#hardest parts over, the rest I have working methods and functions so I'm just methodically putting it together.
#greatly relieved it's going well and coming together and crystalizing nicely. 
Past few days have been tremendously productive in THE ZONE. Likely it will be all working by this weekend at this point
and uploaded to the web on github. Grateful I have not given up. The key for me was reading from the Practical Programmer
and testing with "made it here, etc" that helped localize bugs faster. And I read that Elon Musk used to write big functions
and his new programmers' task was managing the code better putting parts into methods. So I started breaking down massive 5 
page functions down to half a page and creating methods. I really like methods they are easier to grasp their mechanics.
This has helped me tremendously to manage the complexity and reuse more code more easily.
I am 100% confident that the nested switch feature will work now. Again all of the working code exists. I'm just
connecting the modules and testing it to death and adding error detection.

Methodically going thru code pieces to verify everything is working.
The first objective is taking the big string of switches and cutting it up and putting
each switch case body into a list as a string.
I also have to get the switch, endswitch pairs for the whole string and put those line numbers into a list.
Initially it was in a dictionary.

Copying a switch body works given params starting line and ending line within a string
(this is key since I need to cut out each switch body and put it into a list for further transformation)
Cutting out switch body using skipping and keeping switch word works.
Create pair set of switch ,endswitch works.
I have a working dictionary but decided to use a list of sublists instead for absolute simplicty.
Adding comment and line number after each switch works.
Creating threetabs, fivetabs,seventabs,ninetabs switches works.
Combing all of the tab lists works using extend()

I decided I will construct it in sections in a separate file to reduce the code complexity.
I will do this rather than trying to have the whole thing work together which would not go well.
I am doing the gradual construction this way to isolate bugs that are localized by design.

I am working on the construction of the working code in stages to reduce the complexity and reduce the juggling.



12:20 PM  Nov 4th 2021
	
I will add all of the code in one file in a few days to github for the nested module.
This was a bit more complex than I ever imagined to get it to perfectly mimic C switch cases.
I will add the feature of the floating default anywhere within a switch case later.

SUMMARY OF PLAN OF ATTACK #all of the functions and methods work for this to happen. 

Each puzzle piece component currently works right now

determine if switch string has more than 1 switch in it

loop thru switch string and add comment with line number after each switch

create range list of pairs of switch endswitch line numbers from initial string of nested switches

using range list(pairs)  COPY each switch at it's tab depth to endswitch and put into quail list

loop thru quail list and CUT out inner nested switches bodies leaving just switch word (referred to as SKIPPING) thru concatting

loop thru quail list and replace inner switch with nested_method + line number in the comment that it grabs on the fly

##=====================================

#what I worked on this morning was creating a method to grab the commented line number from the first switch in a string
in quail list which will then be accessed in the same order in the stanford list where the python output string will be
I will then add indentation and use the number in the list to put into the def nested_switch_ (number) that completes
the construction of each nested string. I have the cake layer code that concats all of the methods together bottom up and
then it's executed and *should* fully work as it (has been) in testing preparing for this moment.

These are the steps that will be welded together likely tonight.

going thru the entire mega switch string a comment is added after each switch like so:  switch(exp){ # 33  
and the number added using replace is the respective line number within the mega initial strating switch string
	
the triggering of the nested switch functionality (gear box) is triggered by bypass205() omage to bypass of Portland in Oregon
if switch count in string is > 1 and endswitch count > 1; if True then proceed with bypass205()
and all bypass205 does really is call the same methods to convert a string into python but appends it to a list
instead of executing it.

	
first part = create list of pairs of switch, endswitch numbers called rangelist and referred to as pairs also
this involves taking the big combo switch string with nested strings and locating the location of each switch and endswitch pairs
based on their respective tab depth before the word switch and endswitch
the pairs list looks like pairslist=[[1,100], [22,33],[44,56]]
the key is that the pairslist is organized in a specific prescribed fashion of one tab, three tabs, five tabs etc
the reason for this is in case there are several (branches) starting at 3 tabs within the body of the main switch at tab 1.

using the rangelist several different methods will manipulate the switch strings in a sequence in stages.

#COPY switch strings and append to quail list
looping thru the rangelist copy each switch to endswitch at the same tab depth
and append each switch string to a list
	
#SKIP switch string body of inner switch strings (cut them out essentially) this is done by concatting the string to manipulate it

Next looping thru the list 
each switch string is reduced to only one level deep nesting by cutting out the inner switch body but leaving the inner switch word
#example
switch(exp){ #22
   case "will work":
	print("nice")
	exp = 2
	switch(exp){ # 33  <<=== notice only the switch word remains the body has been cut out
	print("every nice")  #also notice that the depth within a string is only at 1 tab and 3 tabs
	
Then the inner switch word is converted into a nestedswitch method with it's id number and braces are removed
switch(exp) #22
   case "will work":
	print("nice")
	exp = 2
	nested_switch_33(exp) # 33  <<=== notice only the switch word remains the body has been cut out
	print("every nice")

What is going on is that each set LEVEL is managed by representing a template copy in a sense of
one level switch with a 2nd level nested switch as a method
and this is repeated for each set and in python each switch is it's own separate nested method numbered to prevent name clashes.
however the method methods for the first switch at the top in a string have a nested method added after going thru the parser

#twin list 
wrote code to get first switch id in the comment before it's sent thru the bypass205() and turned into python
the list of switch id numbers in order will be utilized for creating the nested_switch numbers

Oh. Yesterday I nixed the idea of using a dictionary which has weird rules and bugs so changed
back to using a list with sublists for managing the pairs of switch endswitch pairs.
I then made a get() method for grabbing pairs from the list.

worked on dynamically building the combininglist of tabs which is used throughout the code to manipulate switch strings.
example
it will take in the max tab length for a switch in a given string as input
and based on that number determines how many of the tablists to add
if just 3 then just threetabs
if it is 5 then it adds together threetabs and fivetabs
first time I've ever used the extend method and happy it worked, was vexing before discovering extend

combinedlist = threetabs + fivetabs + seventabs #this looks dirt simple but doesn't work like this in a function (oh darn)
this can handle up to fifteentabs but it can be as much as desired, artificial stop at fifteen tabs for switches initially.
		
The purpose of the combinedlist is is is utilized throughout the preparser to grab with the pairs
the switch strings which are seperated using the combinedlist itself.

example of the function in test mode
#dummy code for testing ....
threetabs=[[22,33],[44,66]]
fivetabs =[[55,58],[77,86]]
seventabs=[[88,99],[102,110]]

Home Strech. I nixed using a dictionary and am using a list with sublists for the switch endswitch pairs.
Making custom methods so it does the same thing as the dictionary methods. I find it simpler and cleaner than using the dictionary.

Testing each stage of the process of getting the switch and endswitch pairs. 
After the indendent stages work by themselves connecting them
will take just a few minutes.

Essentially doing massive testing and simplying and
slight refactoring right now. 

In summary working on testing and streamlining taking in the input code
and preparing it for the parser string before it's sent into bypass205() 
and the rest is gravy. I am thrilled it's going to work.

All Systems Green. 
When the code works it feels like this: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX1Y2JMK6g8
	
All that is remaining is connecting the last few puzzle pieces(already working) that put the output python
switch strings into their respective methods and adds indentation and concats in cake layers and executed.


Worked on and refined replacing inner switch word with dynamically built nested_switch which uses the comment id line number
which is added on the fly. I also replace the endswitch with the } brace conforming to C and JavaScript.
Conversion of inner switches works for n number whether none, 1, or many - any amount flawlessly.

this:
	switch(exp){ #62
		case 'burger':
			print("do something")
			####################
			switch(exp){ #66  
			#############
			print("yep")
			fallthru
		case 'more':
			print("nice")
			break
		default:
			print("we are done here")
	endswitch #86   
				
#######################################################	
is transformed into this: this is then as a string added to a list that is then
fed thru the parser which triggers bypass205(x) which translates each string seperately into python code
				
	switch(exp) #62
		case 'burger':
			print("do something")
			####################
			nested_switch_66(exp) #66
			#############
			print("yep")
			fallthru
		case 'more':
			print("nice")
			break
		default:
			print("we are done here")
	} #86

Working on testing and ensuring that I can fill the dictionary(struct) record with data
and then access it on-the-fly accurately. The dictionary is loaded from a list of the switch pairs.
Recently worked on proof of concept walking thru steps and connecting parts to make sure that the chain of events
is accurate and in the right order. Testing with actual data to ensure that bypass205() is correct.
Working on the final stages now. at the point of the lunar module about to land on the moon. will continue testing
each separate stage to ensure it works independently (to avoid conflict) and then connect the constellation together.
Super close. I also need to work on next the cleaning up of the python string generated of switch code that
needs to be put into methods named by the switch id number. Just need to test it.
Unreal feeling making it this far. Unimaginable complexity so I had to continue breaking down sections into smaller parts
to manage the intense complexity.

In C for a switch case ... the default statement doesn't have to come at the end. It may appear anywhere in the body of the switch statement. 
I figured out how to make this behavior work so default can be anywhere in the switch case. Simple solution.
In summary, for the switch case implimentation in Python staying true to form of C the default can be anywhere within
a switch case and doesn't have to be at the bottom of the cases. It can be anywhere. I have previously thought it wasn't possible
and then today the simple solution popped into my head. Just move the default to the bottom of the switch case before putting it
thru the parser. It doesn't matter (really) where the default resides if there are no case matches it's irrelevant where the default is
but being able to represent the switch case wholly how it's represented in C is still a great honor. 

I have been walking through the transformation of the nested switches and feeding the split up combo swith string in seperate
file into the bypass205() parser and now working on putting those python output switch strings into the final stage.

Victory is within my grasp now.


#important code that is involved endswitch(), bypass205(), parserguts()
#Monday, Oct 25th, 2021 2:25pm
What I have been working on diligently  is making the code that will automatically split up a combo string
of multiple switches into separate switches and for this to work I had to figure out how to organize and manage
the location of each switch endswitch pair and add that to a dictionary which is used elsewhere.
To prepare the individual switches and the each switch so that it only has one level deep of nesting so
if a switch starts at 3 tabs it can only have five tab indentation switches so one level of depth within it
and then the nested switches within it at 5 tabs (for this example) need to have their switch bodies removed
(after copying them) and then just leave the switch word. All of the switches are numbered by their intitial line
number automatically with a comment which is used to track and manage them. So once the inner switch bodies is
taken out by copying the string and skipping after the position of the switch word down to and including its endswitch
then the remaining switch words needs to be replaced with a nested_method utilizing the unique initial line number comment
that was previously inserted. I am at this point where I replace the inner switch with a nested method that is numbered.
Though I have been a bit anxious to test that the bypass was still working flawlessly that I got working back in June of this
year since I had recently gained some momentum with progress.  And in the past few days I finished several monumentally
complex functions of code to make the transformation seamless preparing the nested switches to be cleaned up and formatted
before running through bypass205 which converts them into python code that next need to have the swich strings put into
the unique method names.

Monday, oct 25th, 2021 1:49pm.
Just did a successful test of bypass205() which resides inside of the endswitch() method that
is called if there is more than one switch case. I fed it three strings that were in the quail list
and it dutifully ran them thru the parser and put them into the stanford list.
So successful test.
Input strings followed by translation into python version of the switch case in the new implimentation.
So moving forward now. Next I need to connect the individual components that I have been working on for
months that gets the switch and endswitch and tab depths for the entire input string and puts the combinations
into a list as pairs of line numbers based on one tab, three tabs, five tabs, seven tabs, etc and then 
puts the pairs in order into a dictionary (got that code working recently).

I was working on creating methods that now work to copy the inners switches and put them into a list.
Then taking out the inner switch bodies leaving just the switch word and then replacing that with a method name
after retrieving the comment id number after the switch. Sounded like cake walk but wasn't quite that simple.

# input strings in the quail list that is the result of these switches having been separated from
# their original combo string.

I was going through my files and reviewing it and I chanced on my test code I wrote back in June.
It shows what is ultimately being generated in terms of the inner switches and main switch.
Also I wanted to state that in essence what this program does is create the illusion that Python
has switch cases that can be nested and look exactly like C and JavaScript switch cases in all repects
with the same running behavior.  So in essence this program is translating JavaScript/C/Lisp syntax
into Python indirectly.

Each nested switch lives in a method with a unique id name which will be its initial line number in the input string
before it's parsed. The main switch is in a method for main_switch(exp) which will be at the bottom and the nested
switches will be above it and the way that it works in reality is all of the switches are put into a docstring multiline
and executed so they are all essentially within a bubble separate from the rest of the code that it resides within.


This is a test file that runs that is what is actually produced after translating the input JavaScript
switch cases into python and put into methods. This is an example of a triple nested switch case and 
how it's impimented as python in Python which doesn't have a switch or case in it.

Working on creating separate component puzzle pieces (small programs) that I will test independently
before wiring them together in a small subsystem. I will soon test running the output nested strings that
have been filtered into the bypass205() method to convert into python. I will write down the steps
for the flow of control and then see how close it is. The next phase after that is adding a method name
to each of the nested strings based on the nested switch which has the id comment number at the top
and then concatting each of these methods into a big string in the building cake upside down so the main switch
is at the bottom. Nearly finished. What an ordeal. Mind warping complexity and problem solving to "discover" a workable
solution. The conversion functions to add the method name and ensure the indentation is correct and the cake layer
builder code all already work. 

Learning the fine art of reducing complexity by breaking up complicated functions into smaller functions
and making tricky parts into separate methods. Momentumn regained - relieved.
I prefer starting method names with a verb which is much more descriptive.

I refer to a dictionary as a struct which is essentially a record in C.

In cruise control now. Moving forward effortlessly.
Added functionality to convert inner switches at 3 tab depth into nested methods based on their embedded comment number
Reduced the function to not even require a method so it's done on the fly freeing from a method call.
Improved simpler design to do the change on-the-fly.

# what this represents is one of the final phases before running the INPUT JAVASCRIPT switch case string 
# thru the bypass205() in the parser that converts a list of nested switch stings into Python 3

# this replaces the inners switch at 3 tabs with a nested method name with the id comment number -added previously
# it will access a list using a loop and they will be put in in sequential order top down
# this can handle any number of nested switches at 3 tabs

I can now cut out the nested switch bodies of the switch strings in the list of separated switches.
What I am doing is I put the the main switch and cut it up by tab depth of inner switches.
Then I go thru each of the switch bodies that have inner switches at level three tabs and take that switch body out
leaving just the switch word.
I then replace that inner switch word with a nested_switch method which is numbered by the original switch line number.

I can now replace the inner switch with a method automatically.
Getting closer to finishing ...
So much testing. 
The disbelief is awe inspiring. I didn't expect it to actaully work as designed and it's totally beautiful.
It's a dream seeing it all come together and actually work as designed. 



This is what the JavaScript switch case code looks like before it's converted into python.
If you notice I transform the inner switches into methods that keep the inner switches separated.
Again this is what the string of the switch looks like before it goes thru the parser that translates
it into python strings. However, the initial switch code allows many levels of nested switches just
like in JavaScript. If you notice there are "thru" and "to" macros that work with numbers. And the fallthru
feature works too. A user can use break or fallthru. Further for the management of the complexity each switch
is actually unique and has an id number based on it's initial line number which is how it's referenced.

switch(exp) {  
	case 1 thru 3:
		print("where's the dog house!")
		print('first prize')
		print('you block head Charlie Brown')
		fallthru
			
	case 4 to 7:
		print('kangaroo hop hop!')
		nested_switch_1(n)  #sample of nested switch 
		print('taught me how to write code')
		fallthru
			
		 
	case 8 to 10:
		print('mocha blast')
		print('== autumn nest===')
		nested_switch_2(n)         
		fallthru
		
	default:
		print('the end')
	}

On verge of finishing. Reviewing the method bypass205() which takes in the switch input strings and converts them
from JavaScript style switches into Python code one by one in a list. 
Yesterday when I got the code working to convert each input string to left justify with just one tab in front of the
switch at the top for all configurations it occurred to me I had succeeded - since it was the last hurdle.
Pure nirvana. 
This code is the second working design to shift a nested string to the left margin

Good progress last night till 11ish too.
Progress straightening out (formatting) switch strings in nest_list.
I can control the indentation on the fly which I need to turn each into a method. 3 lines of code.
That's what I like about Python. Zen is waiting to be discovered when coding in Python.
Feeling energized now. Daily chipping away at the boulder. 
My approach is breaking everything down into small modules that I focus on to reduce the complexity
and to maintain momentum.

After burners are on. I am flying faster now. 
I have the generated list of separated strings of switches.
I can now go thru them and cut out the inner switch (if one) and leave the switch word accurately; will be replaced with a method.
And, I just got handling multiple inner switches at the three tab depth detected and captured line numbers.
I have the code to accurately get the inner switch id number (its original line number)
I have the code working to cut out the proper range of the inner switch body.
The rest is easy because the code after it gets converted to python already works - I did that first months ago.
I have had tremendous progress over the past few days after hitting a wall. 


Wednesday, oct 13th, 2021 11:53 am
Made progress.
I can split up the nested strings -all levels.
I can cut out the bodies of nested switches preparing to add method names swapping out inner switch word.
The light at the end of the tunnel has brightened.
Slow and gradual progress and refactoring and majorly simplifying the code with little prototypes to get it working
using tight efficient methods that are thoroughly tested.
The remaining additions all work just need to be added and tested.


Thursday, Oct 7, 2021  10:28am
Broke through the wall to the other side. Lot of progress.
My code to make the switch pairs (switch endswitch ) based on tab depth is solid.
I am dynamically making and filling a dictionary of the pairs of the sets of switch endswitch
so that I can split up the mega combo switch string into the separate switches.
I can copy the inner switches and place them into a list. I can cut out the inner switch bodies accurately 
which is necessary to make the whole thing work. I have the working code to make the nested methods.
The end of this show is nearing completion. So many obstacles and unforeseen snags.

Relieved the worst is over. Staging the phases of the last steps now.

The complexity is deep so I had to use some clever ticks to figure out what is what.
So... I am using comments to store data on the fly and grab by other functions so that I can tranfer
data and communicate at lightning speed. What I do is I transfer the line number of switches from their
original location which I use as an ID for each switch - it's original line number.
So with that in mind I made a method to add a comment after each switch with it's line number.
And after I do the copy and paste jazz juggling nested switches elsewhere I need to know what switch is where.

Here is that code to do GET SWITCH NUMBER (AND IT'S BODY) AND PUT SWITCH NUMBER AS COMMENT AFTER SWITCH
##===================================================
# example:  before  switch(exp){ 
# example:  after   switch(exp){ #22
# so the immutable string is changed 					   
# this puts original line number in comment after ALL SWITCHES in the first string with nested switches
def add_comment_and_line_number_to_all_switches(inputstring): #this modifies the original string
	print(" .......add_comment_and_line_number_to_all_switch()....this was just called .. ")
	awesome=''
	counter =0
	newstring=''
	print('baseline is red_robin starting appearance')
	print(inputstring)
	for line in inputstring.splitlines():
		if "switch" in line and "end" not in line:
			newstring += line.replace("switch(exp){","switch(exp){ #" + str(counter) + "\n")
			smart_switch_numbers.append(counter) #this is new september 30th, 2021
			counter += 1
		else:
			newstring += line + "\n"
			counter += 1
	awesome = newstring
	red_robin=''
	red_robin = awesome
	print(red_robin)   
	print("smart_switch_numbers=",smart_switch_numbers)  #this is new here too 

print('about to test new code.... oh goody')
add_comment_and_line_number_to_all_switches(red_robin) 
					   
##===========================
##====================================
##  get_switch_number()
##====================================
def get_switch_number(stringname): #this might be for when
# I create copies of the switch body strings
	print(" ..get_switch_number.. ")
	awesome=''
	counter =0  #say it's 3
	#we would be looking in the main string for this
	#not changing line just getting line number from it since it's the ID for the switch
	for line in stringname.splitlines(): #this requires the lines numbers already added 
		if "switch" in line and "end" not in line: #just need to grab the first switch 
			#switchcounter += 1
			x = line.split("#")
			y = x[1];
			#str(y) #turns it into a string

Putting it together and streamlining the steps.
This is bad ass cool. Wow. Mind blowing nesting any depth works. Possibly uploading to github by Tuesday.
Sticking to the tenets of Dijkstra elegance and extreme simplicity. Methods are the key. God I love dynamic programming
and fuzzy logic.

Some code to show the management of complexity. 
What this code does is make the first switch with nested switches and represents
cutting out the first level deep nested switches down to the switch word which will then (later) replaced with method
names calling the next level switch.
This will also be utilized for subsequent (next) levels of switches with nested switches as a template.

Automatically making pairs of switch - endswitch works governed by the tab count.
so now I can proceed with separating the strings of nested switches and putting it all together.
Update on Oct 2nd . I succeeded in splitting up the switch main string with the nested strings into
individual nested switch strings and put them into a list.
I wrote some code that finds all of the switches and endswitches and makes pairs lists. I then can use this
to copy the switch bodies and I know the line of inner switches also.
threetabs= [11, 47, 49, 73]
fivetabs= [15, 38, 53, 64]
seventabs= [23, 33]

The code that finds the switch end switch pairs such as above 11,47

tabsubs=[]
threetabs=[]
fivetabs=[]
seventabs=[]
ninetabs=[]
eleventabs=[]

Hit a wall and broke through it.
For pattern matching of nested switches I needed to be able to determine
if the tab depth like 3:5 and a few 5s were in order like this 3,5,5,5,5
and I needed to get the number of the repeating tab depth which I will use
to know which switch numbers are used since they are numbered top down and I 
actually manage them in parallel by their line number in the original combo switch string.

I am happy to report that I can verify with certainty that I can count the number
of the repeating number accurately and verify that the pattern of a repeating
number is in a sequence. 
I already previously wrote the code to determine the 3:5 pattern  and 5:7 pattern
and 7:9 pattern and 9:11 pattern (tab depth) but I had difficulty determining if
the repeating tab continued and for how many times. Knowing how many of the same
tab number repeats was crucial and now it's solved. I just need to put them into 
methods.

I spent all of the past few days getting the tab diff detector working to detect
tab patterns but only for two numbers like 3:5 and I then had to figure out a quick
and dirty and simple solution after my complex solutions grew in if conditions beyond
belief. I found a method to verify an uninterupted sequence of numbers in a list in this
case I'm using the counter thru a list.

Rounding third and coming home on finally getting the nesting behavior jiving with
the design. The design uses a template based on the main nest method module(reuse is good)
since I'm using slices for each tab indentation level. I did hit some unforeseen minefields 
along the way and they slowed me down a bit and threw me off the tracks derailing my 
momentum but I'm chugging along again.

Just last night I got the methods working to accurately detect where a switch has a nested
switch by tab depth change. Again this is a prescan before the fun begins and it has to
be done automatically which makes it more adventurous and hazardous.

Nested switch location nesting analyzer works.
I can see the light at the end of the Summit Tunnel now in the Sierras.
Days till this is fully operational for nesting feature.


Sunday, Sept 19th, 2021  12:19pm
Engineered solution to determine pattern of indentation pairing.
so if I have a switch with a nested switch with a pattern of 3 tabs and 5 tabs
I can detect the location by line number which I use for the ID of each switch.
I have a separate function that numbers the switches sequentially so I know their promixity.
Just successfully was able to analzye a string of nested switches to determine the 3:5 pattern 
which I will also add detecting 5:7  and 7:9 and 9:11 for now and more later.

The point is since I need to have the nested switches separated and isolated but I need to know where they reside.
So this was a vexing engineering problem that had little to do with coding but had more to do with figuring out
how to analyze and find the pattern of the association of the switches and determine where they live.
Fun * 100 now that it works. Previously it was frustration * 1 million. I wrote the key algorithms yesterday in two hours.
Today I put the methods in loops and am using methods.

So what all of this means is that I can finish the last part of the construction of the nested switches
now that I can accurately detect them after devising a management system and ids line numbers of switches in input string
and since they are numbered top down starting from one I know if they follow each other in a sequence.

For the nested switching to work the user must use tabs for spacing.
#example though in github it butchers the spacing but each tab is 4 spaces. I just copied and pasted it in here.
#the first switch(below) is just one tab indentation. Bear in mind later I will add my macro to uses braces instead of tabs.

Reengineering. Refactoring. Testing. Wiring the modules together.
Nested switches solved and module nearly pristine. Decided to 
make a module with several modoes so just one module takes care of generating each nested string
in parser and a separate module for after python generated.
Got the idea from the module that manages the first main swith with nesting and using that framework
for each next tab level of nesting so it's more eleganta and simpler so only dealing with one level
of switches with numbered nests which have their location address hard coded into the nested_method name.
Just retested to make sure that I can (put) a number as a comment to a switch string after switch
and then (get) it later to be used in the frame nested method in python. So I'm dealing with the 
nested switches like individual frames in a movie so it's managed maticuously with complete control.




Sept 6, 2021
Yesterday engineered managing and orchestrating nested switches.



sept 4 2021
final testing of switch case nested 5 levels deep.
implimenting goto label also. prototype works uses braces for scope based on C.
breaking deeply out of loops possible.


August 28th Saturday 11:11 am Gilroy Starbucks
All systems are green. The code runs ... bug free.

I designed the module to do nested switches at any level and will impliment it this week.
Using fuzzy logic it should be just one page of code. The tricky part was the managing and
numbering the nested switches and keeping track of them.

August 28th,2021 nearly ready for launch of switch case with infinite nesting
First launching switch with single level nesting in a few days. Meaning one level deep nesting initially.
Stage 2 will be launching in two weeks with up to 5 levels deep nesting for now.

Refining the code that combines the switches and puts them into methods after
taking the output in the stanford list and triggering the main switch.
Just retested the auto tabbing and putting each nested switch in python into methods.
All works perfectly.
Just polishing up the code after some welding.
Putting the methods together so it's all automatic.

Thrilling seeing it working.

Next step is connecting the first half which takes the input switch case with nested switches
and separates the strings and puts it into the quail list and then 
it will go thru the endswitch() function where the multiple switches are detected
and will thereby trigger the bypass205() method and convert each string into python
and then what I refined today will be called welding_together_all_python_nested_switches().
So a little bit more testing but the modules work separately currently, just need to
connect them. 

#====================================================

August 27th, Friday, 11:06am Morgan Hill Starbucks
Working code filling the quail list with input strings after separating them.
Found working code main switch string conversion code
which takes out the nested switches and puts in 
a nested method numbered
which I will make a second version to handle
dealing with nested switches with nested switches.
Came up with ingenius naming scheme that gets the
correct address line number and switch it's embedded in
and will impliment tomorrow.


August 26th 12:43 pm
Just got this working
# Thursday, August 26th, 2021 12:27pm 
	# inside of original_stage1.py inside of left folder
	# still need to add the methods to make this section work
	# which fills up the quail list that will be fed into bypass205
	# #this is the section that I'm working on right now ===
	# WORKS not added yet : make pair_list here of pairs of switch endswitch 
	# WORKS not added yet : then  loop through pair_list to fill quail list
	# quail list of strings  using copy_string if at least one endswitch in input string
	# Need to fill quail list with these switch bodies strings
this happens above and before bypass205() is called in endswitch if multiple switches detected 

August 24th, 2021 MenloPark, Ca
More testing and refining bypass205() inside of endswitch().
bypass205() is a method triggered if there are nested switches  embedded in the main switch.
Now I can handle nested switches with aplomb. I just need to integrate 
the sting slitter called cookie_cutter which needs to be called before endswitch().
Cookie_cutter is the string splitter that puts the individual nested switches and main switch into 
the quail list. After being parsed and codegened the strings are added to the stanford list.
Then I will work on integrating the end game of already working code that puts the outoput
python strings into methods. 
I spent the past few days perfecting the pair list called range_list for a newst holding lists
of the switch , endswitch line locations. Initially I was going to use a dictionary and I 
gradually gravtated towards a list of lists.


August 23rd 2021
Designing modificationto handle multiple nesting beyond one level deep up to five levels deep.
This is a coprocessor seperate module engine to modify nested switches with inner switches.


August 22, 2021  11:07am Hollister, California
Will next work on design and management structure and plumbing tool.

Currently finishing each stage and testing independently before connecting them together.
Due to the overwhelming growing complexity after this is finished
I'm making a simple program in javascript to represent simple pictures of the chunks
and location and name of each function and method and what they do with search
to see the design implimentaiton at the function level. And I will be able to click on
a function to see more details. And I will have simple pipe diagrams overlay to see the 
flow through the system. This is a necessity (to be done later) so I can see the structure
archiecture and flow of control and keep the functions behavior purpose clear and 
TRANSPARENT SINCE IT'S ALL INVSIBLE AND I NEED TO SEE IT. This idea occured to me this morning
because I was lost at sea what was doing what and when and I was so many fathoms deep in the code
I couldn't visualize the structure levels I designed. And what was crucial was seeing the structure and keeping
track of what functions and methods were contributing to behaviors.

I originally designed just the main switch to have nested switches and the second design
will allow nested switches to have nested switches to handle  nesting 3 deep. Right now it
limitd to 2 deep and I'm modifying it by tab depth for now for 3 tabs depth main switch
5 depth 2nd level, 7th tab depth 3rd level and 9th tab tabs 4th level depth, more to be added later.

This all happens before the parser and codegen. Organizing the code now.
The second half after the code gen puts the generated swith code strings into methods
and combines in one string wheich is then executed works already.




August 18th,2021 9pm
Engineered working architecture to automatically detect all nested switches
and copy them to the input list. This was more daunting then I first thought.
Happy the worst vexing piece works.  Last piece which happens with generated python
just needs to be streamlined and already works. Tomorrow should be productive.
Greatly relieved this part finally works as designed.

ate up 3 days and set me back a few days from completing this project.
I can see the light at the end of the train tunnel (like the Summit Tahoe on Donnor Pass)
and the hardest methods work beautifully and are debugged.


Perfecting input so the input string is checked for switch count and endswitch count
to determine if nested_switches = True and if so bypass205 is called.
Testing bypass205() thoroughly now.

Reviewing functions and methods to do Cookie Cutter which separates the input
string into the main switch and the nested switches (if they exist) and then change
the inner switches in the main switch into numbered nested methods. That all works.
These are all put into the qail input list and endswitches changed to } also.
Then as a list they are fed into bypass205 inside of the method endswitch().
Afterwards the output of the parser and code gen for each switch is put into the stanford list.

Then the next stage is train yard whereby each generated python switch string is encased into a template numbered method
and indented properly. The numbering is crucial so an id as a comment is put into each nested string
to double check accuracy of identification. This code works. And then the cake layer combo concatter works which connects
the stings are combined and then finally executed.

So the front end activities have been streamlined and automated chopping up the input string if there
is more than one switch. bypass205 has been added to endswitch and testing continues. I sent thru
a few individaul strings to make sure that bypass isn't executed when it shouldn't be.
So I'm focused on the backend now taking the python output of each switch case and then adding
them to the combo cake layers in order - also known as train switch yard since they must be backwards
order with main at the bottom or in other words last.

At this point I have used dummy test data between stages and now I am setting up everything to work
the way that it is designed. So previously I already had 3 strings in the quail list to test bypass205()
which for simplicity just checks the length of quail to determine if there are any nested switches.
Now the next test is starting with a multi switch string, split it up, and fill quail and send it thru
endswitch and bypass205. Then after that I will work on adding the nested number methods.
So I am proceeding methodically to ensure each stage works and carefully weld them together.

What happend today is I activated by bypass feature within the endswitch() method so that I can now
handle singlular switches in a multiple switches so a switch with nested switches. This was a nontrivial problem.
I think I am up to 12,000 to 13,000 lines on the project now. Grateful it works. My biggest program yet. All python.

Up until today this was not implimented into the design. 
A lot of features had to work in tandem and in concert with a multitude of methods 
to make this super complex feature work. Today is a happy day.
I included some of the key code that makes it work.

testing the management of converting a switch with nested switches into separate strings
and then running them through endswitch() method which detects if more than one switch in the string.
If there is more than one switch it triggers bypass205() which separates the switches (not shown in this code below)
and then flips a fuzzy logic flag in the codegen so that each generated switch is saved in a list.
and then combined to make the output for running the multiple switch case.

Just tested bypass205() inside of endswitch() and it worked!!
That was cool. I was slightly nervous and had some speed bumps but overcame my fear and
conquered it with persaverance. #that was the most critical stage converting the javascript/C switch into python
on-the-fly sensing more than one switch. Now for the test I had 3 already separated strings but it did indeed work.
Thrilled. The rest is gravy from here. 

Just test one string which works correctly.
So now the two scenarios work. one switch in an input string and more than one switch in an input string.
Over the moon right now. What a great fight that was.

Working on ensuring each separate small program module works before connecting them in sequence together.

Macro with Hypertalk structure works.swap with is from Algol 60. Verb first with sentence structure. Structured Pseudocode.
"swap 'switch(exp)' with 'inswitch(exp)' in list[0]"

Tuesday, August 3rd time 6:12pm on home stretching approaching home plate.
Worked on building methods to gather together collections of methods together
cleaning up the code.  Working on getting the switch and endswitch lines into pairs which 
are then put into a list. Unreal progress this morning and this evening. 
So working on the first half management of transforming the input switch string into separate files
before it is sent thru the parser and codegen for each individual switch string. All of the code
is completed already. I am just packaging it and organizing it and making it easier to deal with.
Startling how much code is necessary to do this all. Hopefully making the goto label will be less
than two pages of code which will work ontop of the switch case framework.
Might have it stiched together tomorrow and put it up on github.
The nested switch code is completely separate from the rest of the switch to manage
the complexity.

#I will change var and list names and function names. I make them memorable to keep it fun.

Approaching the finish line for nested switches. Likely adding Tuesday at this point.

Testing and still wiring together the pieces.
Flow of Control procress of construction of Nested Switches feature.
I just have to wire them together.
Currently retesting each separate puzzle piece 

1 we start with a string that has a switch in it.
But we are dealing with nested switches and not regular switches

#######=====================
[done] (1)FIRST count how many switches and endswicthes are in a string to 
determine the number of nested switches
jumanji() in fourth_of_july checks for the number of switches in the input string

so if one nested switch then we need to detect the inner switch
if more than one nested switch then we need to detect them and
get their exact location which case and how much indentation etc.
and we need to make a copy of the inner switch string
take out nested switch from main switch and put nested_method in that line
#this is in fourth_of_july.py

#====================
[done] (2)
Separate the nested switches from th main switch
this is done in fourth_of_july.py
building string skipping inner nested switches 
put comment in front of #inner_nestswith so it's not called for now
I also am working on taking out the nested switches after they ahve been 
copied and leave teh switch for the nested switch and then replace
the switch for each nested switch with a method that is numbered
(this is what I have been working on recently)

I think I will have  list to hold the nested switch methods.
They will each be unique depth case (name/number probably number)
I might need to map the number of each to the case name.

create a list in quail list of each switch starting 
with main switch in position quail[0]

#=====================
#not added to endswitch as yet, still beta testing
#this phase is tested successfully at the bottom of official_switch_case_silever.py
[done] (3) inside of function endswitch(sw) #testing in official_switch_case_silver.py
if switchcount > 1:  #then nested switch #this triggers bypass205()
   bypass205()  #this method loops thru the qail list with the switch strings
   and calls the paser and code gen for each input switch string
 else:
    pass 

#=====================      
(4) inside of codegen() the concatted output string sweet
is appended to the list stanford (if nested_switch[0]== True)
# this is working filling the stanford list 
this results in the stanford list having the switch strings
we then reverse the list so that main is last in the list
so that when we conccat them together top down it will work correctly
since the nested switches will be embedded within methods above it

#=================
[done] (5)  working on a management method that is called after the last quail string
is sent thru the parser and codegen
so what I can do is when the count on the last stanford list is reached
then I know it's done creating the python strings output


[done] (5) I need to put the nested_method_number() name where each inner switch was
within the main switch in the correct case and line number

[done] (x) change switch to inswitch and fallthru to infallthru in nested switch strings

[done] (x) put nested switch strings into a method for the nested_switch_number

[done] (x) concat together in a triple string ''' switch main and nested switches in python
    and execute(string)
    
[done] (x) execute string

Decided to reduce the complexity of the nested feature and will manage it as separate stages
that are completely independent but are called in order so that I can manage it more cleanly.
I will connect the pieces to make sure they each talk to each other.

Added put, get to macros today. I was working on a swap to work with lists which didn't go well and then it occurred to me
that since lists are mutable I can just change on-the-fly one list slot with another list's slot simply. Spared me much grief.
Excited that I am wiring together the different sections of the nested feature that I built independently.

Based on time available the whole nested feature will be on the github by Tuesday at the latest. I have Tuz Wed off 
for my buffer if things get mired in the swamp. It is thrilling to have made it this far.

I will also have to do more testing once it's all wired together and then for testing I will add it as a separate
module since it's so complex and so there is no interference with the main module.

	Putting together the submodules for the nested switch codebase. I was going to put it into one program
	but the complexity is deep so I decided to keep it as a dozen submodules that are controlled by a 
	manager submodule so that it's easier to comprehend and fathom it all. There is a lot going on.
	It makes it easier to debug and understand too. So I view it as a dozen eggs small modules - makes it easier
	to manage. Until I came to that realization I was overwhelmed with it all in one place.
	#will take a day or two maybe Saturday it will be complete and I'll upload it.
	This is the current focus to complete the nested feature and activate the bypass205 feature to 
	handle multiple switch inputs. By keeping it modular it makes understanding the plumbing much easier.
	And the system is easier to comprehend and visualize.
	Also I made a debugged gold working version of the regular one switch module I'll upload this weekend.
	It's really interesting that the way that the whole program came together it utterly facilitated
	the ability for the whole thing to actually work. I remember the struggle getting the module to initially
	work without reloading. That was fraught with massive frustration. It's been a rocky road with small victories
	along the way.
	
	Next:
	Working on testing a triple nested switch with three levels deep of switches within a main switch.

It works. Wow.
Nested switches works. Unreal.
I will connect the program pieces together and upload soon.
Need to add some documentation.



Found some code I wrote on July 12th for this moment. Pure Nirvana.
code I wrote to combine the strings and run it. 

Tuesday, July 27th, 2021  8;33 am Morgan Hill Starbucks
Finishing up build cake concattting the nested strings and main switch string and methods and call to main switch.
Everything added (the strings) to a list. Just need to add the triple string component. Running past third headed
into home plate. What a journey.

I have putting main switch string into a main switch method and properly indented.
The main switch string is from the starting point of the generated python.
The output nested switch strings from the python code gen are put into a list and then read individually.
I have a method to loop thru list of the nested strings and build nested_methods numbered in a sequence working.
Nearly finished.

Phase 3 begins the last phase of the Nested Switch Case
I have the output python strings after going thru the parser and code gen (translation the python code)
I just have to test adding the method framing of the python output strings (which already works)
and use the cake layer building (cool method) to concat the list and execute it.

I have to make sure that the test beta nested switches have an input var in the main switch (that works)
and so I have been doing back and forth from my prototoype working version based on output and working
backwards from what it needs to look like to work.

I have tomorrow off so I should make good progress on phase 3 and whatever I get working and ironed out tonight.
The code is in three differnet files so that I have been able to manage the complexity.
I still need to convert some more code into methods to reduce the code base for the nested switches.
The fact that I made it this far proves to me that it's all going to work. 


Phase 1 was scanning the input nested switch string.
Counting switch cases, getting the switch and end switch line numbers
and adding them to a dictionary.
looping thru the main string and copying the nested switches and putting each into a list
then deleting the nested strings (really skipping them) when creating copy of main swith minus the nested switches
but left the nested switch word instact and then swapped it for a number nested_switch method to call it later.


Phase 2 was a pain; very time consuming fraught with tiny details
Ended up making a copy one nested switch method that I now reuse in a loop.
Preparing the input strings that had been separated from the main switch
and taking out the endswitch and swapping it with a }.
And applying the correct indentation (tabs) for each of the switch case strings.
I also built an address manager using a dictionary to keep track of the precise location
of the nested switches in case there are lots of them. Haven't turned that feature on yet.
Number from top down starting at top of main original switch string, level (number of tabs),
case number in sequence, line number within case that nested switch is on, number in series 
of nested switches at same level in that same level. For now it's just using a one digit number.
I also need to test three levels deep to see what happens. Thus far I have done two levels deep 
of nesting and it worked.

Doing testing right now. Finishing up the first half to get the input strings ready for the translation thru
bypass205 and working on that. It runs just found one undersight and it was annoying thinking of how much
trivial and time consuming is necessary when I want to do something super simple so adding a swap macro.
Macros really do come in handy and make code ten times easier to comprehend.
Swap is in a the Burroughs dialect of Algol 60  and now its in Python. What did Tony Hoare say in his hints paper.
"Here is a language so far ahead of its time, that it was not only an improvement on its 
predecessors, but also on nearly all its successors." swap a with b



	


The rush is profound. It works!!!! Nested switches in python works. And everyone said it couldn't be done.
The best part is that it looks like a C switch case in all respects (especially the expected behavior) but it's Python underneath.

Putting chunks of code into methods to clean up the code and reduce the amount of code involved.
Four hours of refining the code to make it beautiful. Beautiful counts. Will add the code here tomorrow.

Made methods for taking out the nested switches from the main switch (after copying them)
Made methods to swap out the remaining switch word residue of each nested switch and replace it with
a number nested_switch method. Gotta get to work so will add more details later.

So the transformation of grabbing the switch string and converting it into separate strings
before sending it thru the parser and code gen are now working.
And, this is good, I already finished the methods for the transformation of the python code
strings to put them each into methods and indent them properly and concat them together 
and then like a class the methods are all within a docstring with a var and called.
This way there is no interference with other switches. They are each completely isolated
and only work together within the string that they all temporarily reside in and then they vanish.


This is the bypass205() in endswitch() that manages the building of the nested switches. It's sweet.
# what you don't see yet is the crucial if (which governs if bypass205() is called
# which is dependent upon if more than one switch inside of input switch string

if switchcount in inputstring> 1:
	bypass205()
#endif

#also what yuou don't see is that at the bottom of the CODEGEN
SO THE CODE IS SAVED AND NOT RUN IMMEDIATELY WHEN A NESTED SWITCH IS TRUE
there is a mighty if if nested_switch[0] == True:
#then it doesn't exec(string)
but instead add the stringto the stanford list
which is later combined and then executed AFTER each string is turned into a method
and reversed so the main switch is at the bottom
	
	
This will be added last. I decided to build the bypass205 sepaately from the code base to get it working first

I decided to make it possible for a user to create custom macros and will
have a file for just macros all in one spot.

Today working on the main switch string formatting before it is fed to the parser and codegen.

Looks like nested switches will be working seamlessly this weekend.
Good progress.
9:49 am
	
Some code. What this does is replace the first line of each nested switch which has switch(exp){
and replaces it with a numbered nested method in a sequence. At this point the inner switch
has already been copied and stored in a list and the body of each inner switch in this current 
string has been deleted. This is the last stage before running the code thru the parser using
bypass205() which can do multiple parser and codegens of several strings and concat them to build 
the combined nested switch on the fly and run it with exec().
	
	So the starting point looks like this:
	switch(exp) {  
		case 1 thru 3:
			print("where's the dog house!")
			print('first prize')
			print('you block head Charlie Brown')
			fallthru
			
		case 4 to 7:
			print('kangaroo hop hop!')
			switch(exp){   #here       
			print('taught me how to write code')
			fallthru
			
		 
		case 8 to 10:
			print('mocha blast')
			print('== 31 flavors===')
			switch(exp){     #here     
			fallthru
			
		
		case 11 to 12:
			print('this is so frustrating')
			print('== window won't go back up===')
			break
			
		
		case 13 to 15:
			print('at starbucks')
			print('== where is my mocah?===')
			switch(exp){     #here     
			fallthru

		default:
			print('the end')
}

The output result looks like this:
	switch(exp) {  
		case 1 thru 3:
			print("where's the dog house!")
			print('first prize')
			print('you block head Charlie Brown')
			fallthru
			
		case 4 to 7:
			print('kangaroo hop hop!')
			nested_switch_1(n)                 #<<=== this is now a method
			print('taught me how to write code')
			fallthru
			
		 
		case 8 to 10:
			print('mocha blast')
			print('== 31 flavors===')
			nested_switch_2(n)                  #<<=== this is now a method call
			fallthru
			
		
		case 11 to 12:
			print('this is so frustrating')
			print('== window won't go back up===')
			break
			
		
		case 13 to 15:
			print('at starbucks')
			print('== where is my mocah?===')
			nested_switch_3(n)               #<<=== this is now a method call
			fallthru

		default:
			print('the end')
}
The code looks like this that creates the behavior.

Massive progress.
The nested cases are copied and put into a list and the main switch string too just now.
I have to fix the indentation for the main string right now. And I have a few more lose ends
but good significant progress.
Next I will turn on the main switch cleaner that replaces the nested switches with a method name.
That code works and I just need to integrate it.

Creating the pair list like this:  [10,20] and adding it to the dictionary was a pain but now works. 
The big leap forward was looping thru the keys in the dictionary and calling the copy_one_nested_switch_string()
Progress accelerated after that finally worked. 

Made many methods to automate everything. Adding records to dictionary. Building records on the fly. 
I am now looping thru the dictionary with the switch case start and stop as params and then calling
the copy nested string method and creating the string for a nested switch which then put into a list of the switch strings.
Just figured out how to automatically add the main switch params to the dictionary.

Monday,July 19th, 2021 10:29am Morgan Hill Starbucks California
between macro works!!!  9 lines of code.

2pm  In short my dictionary works, and I can loop thru the dictionary and call the function to copy a nested string with x and y
params which are now passed along and put into switch_location[0] and endswitch_location[0].
My test used a hard coded dictionary already populated. What was different is I decided to pass the switch and endswitch location
that are in the dictionary value to the copy nested string method. That made it work.

Made my dictionary and can loop thru it to grab each nested string based on the params of start switch and end switch
as value into the dictionary and then when I loop thru the dictionary called pears it copies that switch endswitch set
with the function copy one nested switch. Now I will automate the buiding of the pears list dynamically and 
for the output of running the loop I will have it fill a list before it's passed onto the convert to python stage which already works.

I have a function that loops thru the input switch string and stores the locations of the switches and endswitches already.
Working on storing and accessing switch and endswitch pairs (line numbers) stored in a dictionary
to run thru my function that copies one nested switch. Dictionary uses lists to store pairs
of switch and endswitch line numbers. I will loop thru the dictionary and call the copy_nested_switch function.



Sunday July 18th, 2021 time 11:20 am
I initially made a function that copied one nested switch and it uses many methods to do procedures but works perfectly.
I was then considering making a function to grab two nested switches within a main switch and realized
that I could just use the copy_one_nested_switch function that grabs just one nested switch and use it repeatedly for any more
of nested functions so it behaves like a method. Saves a lot of time. I would then just have to change
the input parameters which are the line numbers within the main switch for the
nested switch start line number and endswitch line number. Like simply moving the needle on the record.

Coding helper methods today to reduce code and aid readability.
Looks like nested switch feature will be working within a few days. Most difficult aspects 
have already been conquered. 

Later this week I am adding the macro between. This will be used as:
This came up because it would make for more elegant Z E N code.
	
	if x is between y and z; representing a range. But these would all be numbers.
	
From Wolfram language between[x[min,max]] 

alpha = int(list_of_switch_range[1]) #min switch line number
beta  = int(list_of_switch_range[2]) #max endswitch line number
if counter >= alpha and counter <= beta:    
#would become
if counter between int(list_of_switch_range[1] and int(list_of_switch_range[2]:

Note regarding macros when, unless, until:
I just tested them to prove that it will work. 
They are based on the Lisp, Ruby, and CoffeeScript implimentations of these expressive and powerful words.

They will become methods in the background like this in the preprocessor: 
# so they aren't free floating apparitions - this is behind the curtain in the preprocessor.

	when(condition   == True)
	until(condition  == True) #loop
	unless(condition == False)
	
so that's how they work in reality in the background.

Further I am adding C style comments for the preprocessor too.
/*
comments here
like this
*/

#which gets translated into
# 
#
#
#

#========================================================

Adding #include filename to the preprocessor. It expands to import filename.
It must be within a multiline string with var name and be called within a function.
The point is that this way the code is more natural as a blend with the heritage of C to all programming
while at the same time not violating any of Python's rules - it just bends them a bit.
Also it will invariably be encased in an existing triplestring var that is being executed and thus would only take one line.
The point is to make the code more palatable and "natural" to true programmers in terms of how they think.
It also plays homage to the heritage and legacy of C. And I decided to add it because I can. I don't like the word "can't".

example:
avar='''
#include filename; 
'''
exec(avar)

#it would produce: import filename

Made progress with splitting up a switch string with several switches.
I can detect the number of switches and get their starting line and stop line.
I can copy the nested switch thus extract it and remove the extraneous indentation so it's flush
with the left margin with just one tab for a gutter.

Working on nested switch process integration. It has ten modular pieces and I'm reducing the code currently.
Putting the code in separate files for testing before integration is completed.
First half separates the switch strings and put the result into a list.
Second half puts the generated python into a list that is then modified. Each string is put into a framework
with a def method. Lot going on so it must be maticulous. Had a rocky road connecting the puzzle pieces
so decided to get unstuck by creating completely separate modules to avoid conflicts. And to go slow and easy to
get to the finish line. Working on first half the next few days to get it solid and automated using lots of
helper methods which aids readability.

Then repeat the process for other nested switches if there are any.
Then loop thru the modified switch string and replace each nested switch word with a nested switch method that is numbered 
top down in order of occurence.

Next stage
This is done to each nested switch string
take a nested switch string which left adjusted by default
and add the nested method def at the top and then indent the entire
switch string by one tab added to the left side

Last Stage
Last stage is concatting the layers of the string sections by concatting
the elements of the list which is full switch case strings which have already been reversed
so that the main switch is last since they will be put into a triple string with a variable
and then executed.

Working on the last stages of connecting the dots for
transforming the nested switches into python and putting them into methods
and into a single docstring and executing it. Doing each stage in a separate file today to get them debugged. They all work already. Six I believe.

Macros are cool. These will be put into methods later.
Had to have a little fun this morning.
Made working macros: when, unless, until  right out of the Lisp playbook. Since CoffeeScript and Ruby also have when,unless,until
I decided to add them for the fun of it. Still in the primordial  stage.

Today I am working on the trapeze the last part connecting the generated python with building the doc string with
the variable to be executed. Adding def nested_switch_number to strings and indenting properly. The puzzle pieces
are completed and I am connecting them together today. Then I will be doing more testing. Then I will upload the code to github.

Example of generated python for doing two nested switches
and the results of it running. What you see below is all chunks from a list
that is looped thru and concatted into a triple multiline string
and then executed. I just added the ability to get an output result from a nested switch
that is put into a list and accessible after the inner switch has completed.

Exciting times
did a run thru of how the output code needs to look and ran it worked.
so I now know for sure how to have the output python strings of the different switch cases to
cooperate and work together. Last file called playtime_testing.py
Monumental last hurdle cleared. What a relief. So cool.

First successful test of looping method that goes thru switch line number list and changes switch to nested method

Final push to tie together all of the loose strings.
Working  on aspects of after the bypass205 has been called and filled the stanford list 
aftger the input strings have been parsed and code generated with the generated python of the main switch string 
and n number of nested switches.
I modified bypass205 cutting the code by 80% by making a method of parser chunk of code which was in endswitch()
I make the build layered cake for concatting the final python nested switch strings and main string and inswitch and infallthru methods.

reverse_stanford_list() #so the order is the nested switches first and the main switch is last on the far right
#this is so that when the concatted string is executed it's in the correct order

build_stacked_cake_string_combining_stanford_list() #this loops thru the stanford list and concats it into a string
# which will be executed

Last night and this morning I refined the method to add the nested switch method into the input string where the 
switch(n){ is currently and replace it with a serial sequential numbered method. Each inner switch is numbered top down
in order. The last part I will add is starting with 1 at the top. Right now it's hard coded. But the method works that replaces
the switch to the nested switch method name. I still need to next put this into a loop to do it automatically instead of manually.

Made progress with parser to read and copy nested switch cases and then delete them (after they have been copied and added to a list) and glue in a method numbered
within the bounds of the main switch on the same line and in the case where the nested switch was. Again, nested switches
are placed into their own methods for simplicity. Yesterday I was able to replace two nested switches with methods correctly.
There is a great deal of juggling that goes and and so I have broken everything down into stages and I work on the behavior
for each stage and soon the constellation of the componenents will be ready to connect together.

July 6th, 2021 Tuesday 12:41 pm Starbucks Hollister, California near Target
Working on mapping out procedural steps to create the process of taking the output python switches in the stanford list
and converting it for concatting the cake with layers (each layer a nested switch)
Each nested switch has a unique numerical number in it's name and has to be above the main switch to be called.
The location of each nested switch has essentially an address for the switch it directly lives within in which case 
(number sequence from top of that switch) and what line number within that particular case.
So I have been working backwards from the end goal of the switch case in python. And I compare with what is currently working
and what the final output python needs to look like. 

	
July 5th, 2021 Monday. 9:47 am Starbucks Santa Cruz Avenue, Menlo Park, California.
	
Decided to divide the nested switch code  component in half to manage the complexity. Reducing the complexity is key.
There was just too much to think about all at once. 
So the beginning is called the Before parsed and codegen and the After is juggling the building of the python components.
I have already make prototype working code for each puzzle piece but now I have to turn them into methods.

The Before part involves determining the switch count, but first checking if the input string has more than
one switch and at least one endswitch. All nested switches in the input string must use an endswitch which differentiates
the nested switches from the main switch. Also indentation is key as always in Python.

This was a happenchance discovery. When I make the main switch with the nested method names placed within it they get called.
so I comment them out until just before the main switch is called.
First half deals with the input preparing it for running thru the parser and code gen.
Second half modifies the nested output builds the nested methods in the layered cake to concat it together and then it's exec(combined_string)

Inside of endswitch() I prescan the input switch string to count how many switches are in the string.
I then have an if condition. 

if switch_count > 1 :  
    bypass205() #this loops thru a list of the input strings of multiple swith strings
else:
   #does regular parser and codegen()

<code>
if switchcounter > 1 and endswitchcounter >=1:
    nested_switch[0] = True
    # the nested switches have already been sensed and put into a list called quail
    bypass205(y) #this runs each switch string in the list thru the parser and code gen and 
else:            # in the code gen they are put into stanford list (appended)  and not executed at this juncture
    nested_switch[0] = False
</code>		

What exactly bypass205() does is quite remarkable.
A normal endswitch(y) handles just one switch case string. But with this bypass we can still just use one endswitch()
but we can deal with a multi-combo-nested-switch of any size. So the bypass205() is triggered by a switch counter > 1 essentially
and then after the nested switch string is divided up into individual switch cases and added to a list I simply loop
thru the list and call the parser and codegen. The other aspect that's different is that at the bottom of codegen()
normally the concatted string of python that is assembled on-the-fly using lists it's executed. 
But in the situation of the scenario of a nested_switch which will have a flag
the output for each generated python switch is stored in the stanford list and NOT executed.

But upon finishing the entire list being finished and filled after translating into python
then another function is called after codegen which takes the stanford list and
adds infallthru and inswitch replaces and puts the nested switches into custome method names
that identify the location in the sequence and level of cases and line number
and then it's executed.
##========================================
#In the sequence of the function calls for the parser
switch_code_gen() #the parser and codegen are called multiple times and add the output to stanford list uninterupted
managing_nested_switch_scenario() #<<========this is called after the stanfordlist has the python switch strings
# this normally by default does just one exec(string)
# but it doesn't execute the string if it's a nested switch
# but it does nothing if it's not a nested switch which is determined by 
# whether the stanford list is not empty
# if the stanford list len is greater than 0
# then it modifies each switch string with methods and concats them with makecake and executes it
#
#so for a normal one switch case string managing_nested_switch_scenario does nothing
#but if a nested_switch is True then it takes the python output strings from the stanford list and
# converts it into a gigantic multiline string encapsulating the methods of the nested switches above the main switch and
#calls the main switch.
#=========================================

A normal endswitch(y) call takes in one switch input string and checks if macros and expands them
But what is different is we are still using endswitch(y) for handling a nested switch by using bypass205()
which is called within the beginning of the endswitch() after the switch counter sensor determines if the input switch string
has more than one switch (meaning it has nested switches) each that must end in endswitch which aids readability, but is also 
a determining factor if a nested switch is indeed nested.
So after sensing that due to multiple switches is true then bypass205 is triggered and just after the switch counter senses more than
one switch is encased in the input switch string then these are separated and put into the list quail. Like a mother quail and her little
babies walking in single file behind her. This separation of the nested switches is done before bypass205 is called.
Then within bypass205 I simply loop thru the list and call the parser and codegen multiple times till n and 
these each run thru the parser and codegen like a regular switch and each is appended to the stanford list to hold the python output
for each switch. From this point the second half of the transformation of managing and executing the nested switch in python continues.


#Looks like this inside of bypass205 when it's called :
	def bypass205(y): #this runs the input strings thru parser and code gen 
	    print("==== bypass205 test =======") #and puts them into stanford list at the end of the codegen
	    del stanford[:] #this empties the stanford list: this initializes the stanford list to empty
	    #loop thru quail and call everything that I normally do for an endswitch()
	    for item in quail: # 0, 1, 2 #so it should call the parser and code gen three times
		y = item #this puts the contents of each string in quail into y 
		#rest of calls within endswitch()
		
Thankfully, the bridge of bypass205() (works) which is triggered in the endswitch after a nested switch string is detected
in input can take in a string of n nested switches and separates them.
I also refined and perfectec my switch detector to detect the accurate number of switches (one main and n nested)
which is critical in terms of accuracy. These are put into a list.
For the second half the nested switches are put into unique method names and then will put into a list.
The list is then concatted and called exec(combined_cake)


July 3rd, 2021 Saturday coding working on automatic nested switch management
I have the design figured out and tested the bypass205() which does the multi switch string - meaning a switch with nested switches.
Everything works. I just need to turn the current raw code into methods so I can automate it.
My example uses one switch with a nested switch and I need to write some fuzzy logic to automate separating the nested switch(es)
from the main switch that they reside in and determine their address position within the switch. I decided for convenience that
all nested switches must use endswitch to end nested switch.
I'm working on the automating of the method naming for the nested switches.
I am working on each new component outside of the main code base and playing with it and then slowly adding each one to the
main code base. This might take another week to refine it.
Last night I had a revelation for creating the main switch and separating the nested switches from the main switch.
Rather than deleting the lines within the nested switches (my original strategy) I decided instead to 
create a new string that I concat and just don't add those strings within the nested switch that I have already copied for
each nested switch. This was out of left field and then I realized that it was a brilliant and simple solution  that is easily workable.

So in review I am working on the section of the code where the switch with nested switches is read and analyzed to determine
what is in it and managing the separtion of the nested switches, noting their locations, naming the switches by location
and then modifying the main switch string so that it looks like the design with the nested switches turned into methods that are called.

Next after that I will work on modifying the python generated for each switch and preparing it to be put into the unique method names
and indented by one tab more to the right and they will each be placed in a list.
I will be using lists heavily for the manageing and analysis.



July 1st, 2021 Thursday 8:17 pm California time Starbucks Gilroy, California
Critical test worked on first try. I didn't expect it to actually work the first time.
Of course I spent days designing it. The rest of nested switch management
is a cakewalk. Stunned silence. Wow. Holy Toledo.

July 1st, 2021 Thursday 7:48pm California time Starbucks Gilroy, California
Working on proof of concept of taking a switch with nested switches and separating it into individual switches. (that works)
Working right now on testing taking the input strings of the (3 test strings) representing separate switches
and running it through a loop with the same contents of function endswitch() but will use bypass205 on 5 (bypasses traffic in Portland, Oregon) 
so that it's controlled and can do more than one string sent to th code generator and grab the string of the python code
and put each generated python switch into a list.
it will do all three separately and then generating the python with codegen
which is NOT exec() but stored into a list which I will do other modifications to before exec().  
That is what I'm attempting right now. It is critical for nested switches
to work. It involves fuzzy logic and flags. Once it works I will add more methods and reduce the code to simplify
and streamline it.

Just solved the missing puzzle piece which turned out to be simple actually. Nested switches will work - as many levels deep as you want.
Now I just have to connect the puzzle pieces. And innumerable number of nesting is possible. You want to do 1,000 nested switches within
one switch. - go for it. Go wild.
I can detect switches (and count them) within a switch case input string.
I can extract the nested switch(s) from the main switch and put it/them into a separate string.
I can then put all of these switches into separate strings into a list.

For each run the Stanford list is emptied at the top before anything happens. This can be controlled at will though.

So the strings of the output strings of generated python are collected in the stanford list in order that the switches are encountered
within the main switch.

If there is just one switch then it's just stanford[0].
All nested switches within the main switch are loaded in the list stanford based on order of apperance(location)
and the count of the stanford list is used to manage everything.

I can run the list thru a loop calling endswitch(x) to generate the python code version.
I can "now" feed each output python string into a list. This is list stanford.
The gathering of this data (harvesting) is completely independent of whether an output switch runs or not (based on flags)
This is important because it's less to think about, dwell on, and less complexity; it's utter simplicity.

And what I have been spending my time on already works. I can take a nested switch string in python output and convert it into
an inner nest method. I can name the method name correctly in sequence with depth(tab count), 
case number in sequence(where it resides within), and line number that the original switch was so it's in the exact line within the case.
Further I still need to add the input list which will feed the input var n or exp, right now settled on n that will fall into the method input
via the list in the background since lists are mutable and so Lispish.
I can also replace the main(mother) switch with the nested_switch method and completely remove the nested switch.
One works, I will work on more nested switches. I am also doing the automatic indentation (smart tabs) for the nested switch methods which are within
methods.

Any depth nesting switches is possible based on this design.

Next I'm working on the layered cake.This includes the method names which are unique to nested switches.
Each nested switch method has a unique name. Further that will be a list variable for input to each nested switch and 
an output list for maintaining the output being live within the running switch.
The bottom layer is the main switch and the nested switches are methods above it.
These are concatted together and then executed.

Fixed bug in converting a nested switch from a regular switch into a nested switch which uses different methods: inswitch() and infallthru()
and is encased inside of a unique numbered(named) method. For some reason replace() wasn't working and it was missing changing the
switch and fallthru into inswitch and infallthru so I did a work around since there is an aparent bug in the replace() method.

Significant progress. modified initial design slightly aiding the construction of the nested switch more easily.
Happy with progress past few days. Going well. Good momentum. 

June 28th Monday, 2021 3:53 pm
Next Three days just doing the design engineering and prototyping of building a nested switch and running it thru
the module to build the concatted strings and then executing it. Each nested switch is represented by a method
and each is generated seperately. It  alpha phase it might work tonight. beta by Wednesday evening. Working on using
lots of methods to simplify and reuse as much as possible. Thankfully the hardest part already works. Just juggling now really.
	
Engineered how nested switches parser and code gen will work. Code name Juggler.
Should be working in a few days. Building it in small components and then
will connect them together and it should work. Using 2 flags. I love fuzzy logic.

June 24th, Thursday, 2021
11pm. After I got it working I redid it in lists and it's much more streamlined and automating it will be simpler.
It's much cleaner now.

8:32 pm California time
Working on functions to insert the nested_switch_method into the parser just before code generation(first one for testing).
After detecting the correct case number where the nested switch is and the line number in sequence within the case
I worked on tonight copying the case body lines and then insert the nested_switch on the proper line
and rewrite the case body lines to insert it. Refinining the algorithm now that it works. Decided to just use strings and not lists for this one.



June 22nd, 2021  9:17pm California time
Did some more testing. I was just copying and pasting C switch cases off the web to see if they would run.
So far a missing break in default doesn't crash anymore.
But using the word "case" anywhere other than for case name; like in a print statement causes a crash.
And since it's python if the indentation isn't correct per the design it will crash.
one tab in front of switch
two tabs in front of case
three tabs in front of line below case word
etc, etc
So, this means if a programmer copies and pastes C or JavaScript code it won't parse and run unless
the indentation is correct. So I will next workon auto-indent detection and fixing for switch cases.

Right now I am heading full steam ahead on finishing up the construction of the output python generated
from the input switch case string for nested cases which is extremely tricky but luckily through sheer determination
I am making daily progress. I expect it to be solid and bug free and working by the 4th of July at this point.
The project has exceeding my expectations and had I known how deep it was going to be like one hundred fathoms
deep I might not have attempted it but it's a fun project nonetheless.

June 22nd, 2021 Tuesday time 12 noon Santa Cruz Avenue Starbucks near Stacks and Cafe Borrone in Menlo Park.
I just saw and an example of the new match case (the new switch case for python) that I'm competing with.
It had an example with function calls from inside of cases. I realized I hadn't tested that scenario other than
my buildstring() method and adder() for math water fall style so I just got that feature working. Bad ass.
To work the new functions(methods) are put into a file called method_calls and that file is imported
at the top of official_switch_case_silver this way the user (developer) doesn't have to
actually fiddle inside directly in the switch module but this way it will work and it's 
easy to use and clean.

In other news I successfully have started the conversion process of taking the output of a nested switch and 
changing it into nested mode this way I can run it through the parser and codegen with zero changes and then make
changes afterwards which is more zen like. And I will merely use the nested_switch flag to determine which
switch case going through needs to have changes to the nested mode after the code gen is done.


Example below
sw ='''
	switch(exp) {  
		case 1 thru 3:
			print("where\'s the dog house!")
			print('first prize')
			do_something()
			print('you block head Charlie Brown')
			fallthru
			
		case 4 to 7:
			print('kangaroo hop hop!')
			print('taught me how to write code')
			do_something_else()
			fallthru
			
		 
		case 8 to 10:
			print('mocha blast')
			print('== 31 flavors===')
			fallthru
			
			
		case 21:
			print('Blake you did it a real good job')
			print('macros working in Python')
			print(' I did it - it works')
			
			
			
		default:
			print('six walking duck de fa ul t')
			print('flying geese')
			break
}
'''
endswitch(sw)

With my new approach the code generator has fewer hiccups.

Had difficulty with nested stages so for safety using working switch case and s l o w l y connecting the
stages together to prepare the python generated switch which is extremely different then a regular switch.
Slow and easy wins the race, and rushing is never good. Working continually backwards and now only sticking
to the set up and not trying any curve balls to make it work. Making more methods for the delicate engineering
so it will ultimately mean less code and easier to manage and comprehend.

What I got working today was inputing the input for the generated nested switch method. It was tricky but I solved it.
Since I made the end output which runs the real tricky part was getting the input nested switch to translate
and then after extreme difficulty I ended up keeping it in regular switch mode to run thru the parser and code gen
to generate the switch code output and then I am making the changes to make it work within a method which then calls
itself. When the bugs started stopping all forward progress I was forced to break it into smaller chunks and greatly
simplify the stages of the transformation. Fortunately the prototype works and using a representation of a nested switch
within a method is the saving grace for this actaully working. 

I also had to detect tabs and had no fun in figuring out how to subtract tabs from the front of lines and add tabs
to create the correct indentation since the switch is within a method. But I overcame that obstacle with steadfast 
determination and absolute commitment. The end of this project is near. I am going to make a new folder with
the key files in it so that I can focus on the end game. Right now it's coming together and by having smaller chunks
that I can manage it's easier to control the behavior of the nested switch methods.

To make it work I am reducing the nested program into ten small programs to bring order to the chaos
amd reduce the complexity. Once the puzzle pieces work doing their specific small behavior the nested switches
will fly.


June 21 Monday, 2021 time 12:35 pm starbucks Santa Cruz Avenue in Menlo Park, California (Cafe Borrone closed today)
Finishing the last aspects of connected the layers of the cake together.


Looks like July 4th project Tron will be completed.
C style switch converts to python 3 on-the-fly and runs.
Right now bug if case used inside of a block of code beneath a case. I will have it ignored to bypass it. 
Nested switches as deep as you want.
Just finishing the nested switch engine. Parser works. Working backwards on Codegen to assemble and link
together the output generated python with nested switches treated as methods which is done with encapulation within a string.
So after a nested switch is extracted from a regular switch  it is copied to a list.
Then it is run through the switch module and converted into python.
This is where the fun begins.
Swapping words switch to inswitch and fallthru to infallthru.
I then create a new unique method name and concat the generated python and add indentation.
Just solved problem of adding input var to trigger the switch by putting it into a list
which is accessed when the nested which (living in a string) is called the innerswitch method (when called) accesses the list[x]
and then it functions perfectly. If lists were not mutable this would be extremely difficult.
Everything for the engienering is been broken down into small pieces. Working on the creation of the goal
string representing the already translated python switch representation. 
Battling bugs with careful maticulous design and frequent testing.
Created a staged apporoach of rocket modules that are independent but run together in a sequence to manage the complexity.
Note: each nested switch is represented as a method that is made on the fly and triggerd by the method name call.
This aids readabiliy and clears away clutter and allows the management of the insane complexity of juggling literally possibly
thousands of nested functions within the maze of a switch case that could conceivable reach millions and depth of an unknown n
since all code morphs and changes seemingly at will as design requirements evolve.
This address feature might involve a fourth parameter for safety perhaps. Time will tel..
Victory approaches. Address location of nested switchs. Still need to make simple numbering of nested switches x for depth level y case(as sequence number) residing in, 
z if multiple (as a number in sequence of nested switch possibly in a series) within a case. ie, 3 nested switches in a series within a case

successful test detecting innerswitch JavaScript/ C style input string copying to list
successfully translated it into Python (didn't execute when attempted though)
Did some fiddling to get it working 
Successfully ran test python innerswitch encased in a function nested_switch_1(n):  
and I learned what needs to be included for it to work. And the the nested switch
ran with exec(fiddler[1]).
For some strange reason the generated python of the nested switch (which wasn't in a method) 
had unforeseen issues so I worked backwards to a file with working python and will figure out
how to correclty generate the correct code. Tomorrow I will correct the translation process 
from input string in list to translated to python string neighboring list.
Bear in mind that the reasoning behind this is the nested switches should ONLY run when they
are triggered to run and not to run otherwise willy nilly. That would be bad.(not good)
I have been focusing on detecting the nested switches and copying them and placing them in a separate
string and then appending to a list in order of occurence. That went smoothly.
I was able to set the nested flag to True and the codegen correclty added the output string to a list
however all of the necessary ingredients to make it actually run were lacking. I neglected to put it into
a custom method and it was lacking access to the lists of the cases and so it was learn as you go to solve it.
Listening to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wLwxmjrZj8 Space Ambient Music to focus.
When I tried to exec() the generated python representing the nested switch it didn't run. So I had to backtrack
to working experiemental code and then it made more sense how to get it working.
								   
Another issue popped up to add a tab to each line in the nested switch which is glued inside of
unique nested switch name. Wrote that the other day thankfully and it works like a charm.

Progress on code generator for nested switch cases. This is massively complex and I have simplified it to make it work.
Flag worked to detect if nested switch
added generated python switch to list.
Practiced adding 4 separate nested switches python to list as strings.
Then I started writing methods to manipulate them transforming them for behaving as nested switches.
Converted switch to inswitch and fallthru to infallthru.
Made method to generate nested switch method names dynamically for level and depth since each has an address.
Made auto-tab method.
It's all coming together, building the puzzle pieces and practicing what needs to do what and when.
Did click thru walk thru of process of transformation and building the string with the
nested switches in methods and now working on transformation for
the main switch with the nested switch method which looks like this:
inner_switch_1('test4') #however it can also accept a variable so it can be a list[0] input or x, etc.
Probably till end of weekend till this feature is solid and I'll upload it.

June 17th, 2021  10:55 am
Fixed bug that crashed module finally determined it was triggered by the word "case" in a print statement within a case.
Built auto-tab method creationg for my generator.
Built string stacker method to build nested switches stack in correct order with main switch at bottom.
Nearly done with stars of the constellation to make the small system work. Coming together quickly now.
Working on building output stack of strings of inner nested switch methods with generated python code
and the main switch that has the innerswitches embedded in it. Working on the code gen half now.
The parser part now works for grabbing the nested switches. I just have to trigger calling the switch module
from the input string switches in a list for each nested switch and the main switch and then putting the output
strings into another list that will be used to concat them all together before calling them.
More progress testing the generated python methods for the nested switches and the main switch
which has the nested methods inside of a case to represent doing a true nested switch. Unreal - it's working.
Battled bug from hell last night for 5 hours ValueError: None not in list. It was seeing the word "case"
in a print statement which crashed the program. I will add an if to fix it later. Case works but case crashes. 
Massive momentum this morning on constructing parser and working on codegen.
I put each input nested switch and the main switch in raw C style switch form in a list that each is appended to.
Then I will call the switch module and translate with nested_switch[0] set to True so that the generated python string
is not executed but instead is added to another list which then will be used to build
the large multline string in the proper sequence and then and only then executed.
I refer this technique to trapeze from my experiences at Club Med. It's all a process and lists make
it so much simpler to follow the logic of the steps and manage it.
I use a flag to deactivate executing the python translation and instead save the output python string
to a list which it is appended to. And then I already wrote teh code to reassemble it building a string
that will then be executed. For this mulity layer cake string to work I first insert (add) the 
methods for the inswitch() and infallthru() which are used in the nested functions and each nested switch
is encased in a separate method to prevent interference with other switch and fallthru calls.
example of some code of a nested switch function.

Note. I decided on a rule for nested switches to aid the parser. At the bottom of a nested switch
the progarmmer must use "endswitch". However, so I don't get flamed I will allow "}" for C purists to end a 
nested switch and not absolutely require "endswitch". So both camps are happy. It aids readability and it's used in PHP but it differentiates
from the } and it's easier to ascertain that the switch being examined by the human(s) is definitely
a nested switch.

Made more progress with code gen for nested switch design and tab counter and tab inserter for auto-indentation
Made progress on parser yesterday and today leaps ahead of where I thought I would be due to dogged determination.
Working on both parser and code gen and will next generate the python code with regular module by
just adding a flag if nested_switch[0] == True so the generated module won't be executed but will
instead be added as a string to a list with each position representing the number of each "nested switch" within 
all encompassing main switch that they reside in no matter how deeply nested the switches are.
First doing two one level deep nested switches. Will try triple level after success.


June 15th, 2021 7:31 pm 
Good progress at Starbucks this morning. At this pace it should be working in sections by this weekend and then
I will connect it together by Sunday.

Grabbing nested switches and copying as a new string to a list.
Swapping switch and fallthru for unique method names works
Working on calling switch_module to translate each nested switch to python tonight.
Steady progress. Bringing the realization of each phase of the translation conversion into reality.
Just like falling dominos once each independent stage works the whole system will work.

DESIGNING UNIQUE PARSER AND UNIQUE CODE GENERATOR TO IMPLIMENT... nested switches in Python.
First I'm looking for the patterns to reveal themselves so I can create the formula and templates.
Alpha attempt will be a switch with 2 nested separate switches depth 1.
First attempt will be one nested depth 1
Second attempt will be two nested depth 2
third attempt will be three nested depth 3

NESTED SWITCH IMPLIMENTATION special parser and special code generator.
Have to detect inner switches first.
Will hopefully see blossoming of nested switch analysis and generation within next few days.
The theory is strong it's just a bunch of little steps. 
Doing step through design of parser detecting inner switches
copying and storing inner switches in separate named strings
creating template for the code gen

copying modifying the module for generating a switch to generate nested switches with unique method names
Made dummy test data switch with two nested switches  and doing step analysis to convert into code gen layout
to generate the python variant which will have unique sequentially numbered innerswitches inserted into main switch
strategicially positioned in precise case sections.

I have tomorrow off so should have process figured out and step sequence clear by tomorrow night.


June 13th, 2021  7:50pm California time
Designing the multiple switches parser at first seemed tricky but I simplified
it to treating each nested switch as a domino. I then realized I can just make
a list with each nested switch as a string and then run them thru the existing parser to
create the output string(but not exec() it) and then the output string can be added to a second list
and then in order I concat each of these nested switched along with the special methods for handling
the nested switches above these and then I do the main switch again thru the existing switch module
to translate it into a string and then 	(my thinking was actually from the stripes in the American flag)
and then exec() the produced finished string. The test I just did on test output proves the concept is sound.
Chipping away at the boulder one by one and modular development is the key and absolute confidence it can be done
are all the keys to victory.

Did proof of concept running test switch with two nested switches(as methods) and it worked.
So the theory is sound. The first time I tested it in a real world situation.
Working on parser now for nesting. The theory is based on runners(each nested switch) on bases in baseball. Instead of looking
at the problem as one big chunk of code it's managing the chaos by reducing the problem set to similar problems.
So what could be mind boggling chaos can be conquered with order and simple design techniques. I never imagined
that this was all going to actually work. On StackOverflow whenever someone dreams up their design and implimenation of a switch case
for Python they always get a comment (unanswered) can it do a nested switch? I was determined to make mine work. 
I actually got the idea of putting the nested switch into a function from the solution of how to break out of a 
nested for loop with a return inside of a function since break only breaks out of one but not both loops. It works nicely here too. But the solution isn't obvious at first
but it works. It's quite profound. Seeing code work is such a thrill. 

The parser for the nesting is unique but I will use the initial parser and
codegen to create each individual nested switch translation which is then added as a string concatted top down
to create the illusion of the nested switch whereby each nested switch is actually a method inner_switch_n with a sequence
number so it can be called. Thankfully I designed this back a year ago in pydev and it involved a great deal of thought.

first_string_test_nested_switch.py  and test_generated_code.py
Designing special parser which translates the inners switches first concats to a string
and then adds the main switch at the bottom and then executes it as one block.
So the individual nested switches are translated into a python string and referenced in a list
and then all concacted together above the main switch so they all live within the same string
which is then executed together. I already thought thru the parser and the way it works
is I number the switches (I get the count first) and then I note the location (line number)
of each switch and endswitch and the case that each inner switch resides in which case (numbered
sequentially and the level of depth derived from the tab count in front of each nested switch to determine depth.
Bear in mind in reading the input switch string it will look just like C/JavaScript code so a deeply nested
switch might be many levels deep and I need to derive the exact case it's in and count tabs to determine it's location
so I need to deduce the level and depth and number each nested switches precise location which could be several levels down.
											

June 10th, 2021 7:31 am California Time
Making progress on parser and code gen and design logic for nested switches.
Working code that will be the running output.
Uploaded proof of concept working three level deep nested switch case
which demonstrates it working. It will be generated but this
show the python implimentation that will be generated.
nested_switches_gold.py

I'm designing the special parser and code gen.
The parser will be a multiple pass using a loop and lists
to generate each nested switch  and fill the incoming data
with the logic done with fuzzy logic.
It will be working within a week.

Taking out print statements and cleaning up the code.
It works. I just got the UPPERCASE CONSTANT style of C working like this:   case CALIFORNIA:  which is converted to a string.
The point is having the look and feel and behavior of ANSI C style switch cases. I added macros for numbers (to see if it would work)
and it did.  This works:  case 1 thru 10:   and this works case 1 to 10: So they get expanded to save time typing.
Right now switch needs to be indented one tab, case is 2 tabs and inside of case next line is 3 tabs.
My next version will provide freestyle so indentation will be auto-indent but not currently working doing auto-indent.

works for fallthru adding or concatting strings in switch
example in file too and code works

June 5th 8pm  2021

8:10pm Just found my nested switch code I coded a year ago. What a rush.
	
Encouraging progress. Can correctly detect number. Looks like lowercase, uppercase, and alphanumeric will work.
It's all really about detecting if a solid number or alphanumeric and converting it into a string.
Scary test where nothign worked and I realized whoopse I didn't have it converted into a string first and the parser
choked on it. Funny. But initially scary. More progress tomorrow and updates.
Successful testing across the board tonight.



June 5th, 2021  6pm
Will just do C style UPPERCASE case for now to get it up and usable and add the other versions later.

Right now number of case sections is limited to 10. I will up it to 256 tonight. It can be as many as you wish actually.
Decided to let it work in all lowercase and alphanumeric too as an option.
So it could work as case lake_tahoe:   and as case lake_tahoe2:  and as case LAKE_TAHOE5 and case lake_tahoe_6:
in addition to standard ANSI C   as case LAKE_TAHOE:
Right now it works converting the stringified version into python code and I'm adding the sniffer tonight 
as a filter to detect whether it's a nonstring word constant and if so to stringify it.
Nearly done taking out the print statements with comments in the code base.
I added flags for viewing the input string switch and viewing the output generated python code
so these can be flipped at will for each switch case whenever a developer chooses.
Just above switch case string.

I still need to add ERROR CODE MESSAGES for bad input for nontraditional switch case style.
Such as missing default. Default not at bottom. No break after default. Improper indentation.
Bear in mind I will be adding a freestyle no indentation necessary version soon that will add
the proper format indnetation automatically. I prefer to think about my code and not dwell on tabs myself.

hide_input_switch_string()   # input string in doc string with var sw
hide_generated_code()         #this is the generated python code
or 
show_input_switch_string()   
show_generated_code() 

Also, the other night I changed Sutter to Adder(x) for the fall thrus to do math and looking at the function
a developer can easily modify it for doing more complex math. In example each element can be added to a list
and then eval(result) to use a formula and do a complex calculation. I left BuildString(x) the way it is
for concatting a string thru fallthrus.

Going through my previous code to see how I got a nested switch case working.

I will show working goto label next. The goto works already but I wanted to get the switch case working first.

I will also add when, unless, until macros via the preprocessor the same way I made to and thru work
for numbers in the switch case using replace and a prescan of the input string.



May 31st, 2021 Monday 9:19pm California time.
I never thought that this would work but it just did. Will upload it likely tomorrow or the next day.
It converts it to lowercase and it works. I wrote a few functions that I will test more tomorrow but it works.
It's a Constant uppercase switch case based on C style. Oh, I am working on auto-indent but that will take
a while so maybe in a week or two for that feature. I will add examples of tumbler adding thru fallthru
and concating a string in the next few days (they already work).
Also right now the upper limit is 10 cases (sections) I will move it up to 256 matching the C standard this week.

Results down below.

Taking out print statements in code.
Deleting unused code. Will upload latest version tonight.
Working on case CONSTANTALLCAPS:  style from C currently but it won't be uploaded for a few days.
Irregardless I will be updating the working switch with macros for numbers works to and thru and numbers switches
running before and after word switches. The module I made is solid.
I will add a feature for debugging to see the generated python for the switch which would be
#show_generated_code_on  this is not implimented yet

Also working on auto-indent so a swith can be done without indentations ala C and JavaScript and then it
is automatically indented with tabs. The flag to trigger this would be #auto_indent_on  at top of input string above switch(exp)
The idea for this came from copy and pasting which is disasterous in Python but this would use fuzzy logic to determine where
to indent properly in the code generator. But actually it doesn't really have to be indented. Information can be gleanded from
the input switch string without indentation as a guide.

It works. Switch case works mimicing look and feel style and running behavior of C switch described in Yale University C style guide.
Just need to take out print statements.
Numbers works. Macros work. Preprocessor works. Words for cases works.
Works without reloading module. Cutting out unused code. Surreal feeling seeing it work.
Also tumbler works to do math in waterfall mode via fallthrus in switch case as it cascades down.
And tumber for concatting a string dynamically works using the fallthru waterfall.
Testing nested switch this week.




May 29th 7:29 pm California time.
cases with macros and numbers now works!
But I have a bug whereby cases with words stopped working so that's likely a boolean bug.
Will work on it tonight.
Exciting progress.

May 27th 8:27pm California Time
A fallthru can be explicitly stated with a word fallthru or fallthrough
or implicitly represented by the absence of a break

in the switch case a fallthru is designated at the bottom of a case with:
either explicitly as fallthru or fallthrough or implicityly with nothing -the absence of a break
a break is designated with break
so the absence of a break means fallthru implicitly
fallthru is my preference but I added fallthrough from Swift

May 27th, 2021, 7:36 pm California Time
This is the macro expansion showing the input switch string with macros and after the macros 'to' and 'thru' are expanded.
I made this a separate module to reduce the complexity. It was a bear to get working but I prevailed.

I separted macros in the prototype and realized I needed to finish the fallthru tumbler. I already had
it adding numbers while falling thru fallthus in each case. I fixed the math. So that works.
I then thought of how I have used fallthrus in switch cases in JavaScript and it's to build strings concatting.
So I now have concatting strings thru falling thru fallthrus between cases. That was relatively easy.

I will upload the macro expansion preprocessor file and then add it to the main file and upload that.
I will add the string concat tumbler and the math adder tumbler later depending on how things go.
I felt like I was done and realized fallthrus are used a lot to concat strings so I had put that off a while
and just modified the adder of numbers to adding strings.
The program just kept growing and blossoming. I never expected to make it this far because it was a nightmare to engineer.
I got really lucky through sheer persaverance and dedication.

Separated macros functions for preprocessor and reworked endswitch(). I will upload it tonight. 
So now by tonight numbers using macros to and thru will work.  case 1 thru 10:  and case 11 to 20:
It also means I can now do (soon)  when, unless, until in conditions just like in Lisp and CoffeeScript and Ocaml.

Yesterday the macros to and thru worked properly. will likely upload it this weekend.
So I am in the process of adding the macro expansion code to the main file likely this weekend.
This means that a switch case with numbers can look like this:  case 1 thru 20:   and also like this case 23 to 56:
And the stringifying works so it turns all numbers into strings which  then run through the string based parser.
Accidents in code are great learning experiences for finding a radical new way of doing soething. 

And just now I figured out how to do tumbler of either concatting strings or doing math using
the fallthru feature in the swith case just like the behavior in C with fallthrus and in JavaScript.
That was tricky. It took 30 minutes to solve. I put it off for months because I had no idea how to make
it work. Everything I tried failed and then I saw my fallthru and I thought, why not try a function
and it worked like a charm. Quite thrilling actually and a simple solution. Not obvious at first. Had a few Type errors that
through me off track but I got right back onto the track. I didn't think it would ever work and nearly gave up
but I knew people would complain if I couldn't perfectly duplicate the behavior of C and JavaScript Switch cases.

C constant case names have been solved. 
Oh, more news. I solved doing this type of case just like in C. 
Using CONSTANTS   so like this case TARGET:    and case LAKE_TAHOE:  which then I will just convert into strings
like what I wo with numbers.

I will put the methods and functions into a separate module tomorrow. I wanted to post a few of the methods
so that everyone knows it's real. I took the output from the macro expansion and used that generated switch string
as input in my working multiple switch file and it ran. Surreal.

Testing beta code of expansion of macros  in Blender and Tang before I make a separate module
for macros.
The most important main function that controls how the expansion works is this method.
