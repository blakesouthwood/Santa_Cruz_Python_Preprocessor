    test code sample output to refine it.
    this is just putting the puzzle pieces together to get the right output
    for searching through the cases in Python
    This is test mode and it will look very pretty later.
    It's codegen output so the dyamic strings and ironing out the bugs.
    Test data so the cases don't match yet. Just getting functionality working.
    this is looping through 5 cases and outputting the python code for
    five cases. there are breaks because to make it work it uses a while True loop.
    I think I'm up to 4,000 lines of code now for this project which I'll pair down to
    1,500 by writing some methods for small behaviors.
    
     
counter= 1
if case in caselist1: #  ['apple', 'money']
===
	 print('Excellent!')
                    	 print("testing");
                 
===
			break
===
--------- end loop =======
    
    
    counter= 2
elif case in caselist2: #  ['bananas', 'coconuts', 'strawberries', 'tangerines']
===

print('Well done')
if color == 'red':
print(color)
else:
print(no color)

===
			break
===
--------- end loop =======
    
    
    counter= 3
elif case in caselist3: #  ['chocolate', 'marsbar']
===

print("You passed")
print('working on this')

===
			fallthru("apple")
===
--------- end loop =======
    
    counter= 4
elif case in caselist4: #  ['fish', 'peanuts']
===

			if failure == True:
				 print('failed')
			 else:
				 print('keep trying')

===
			fallthru("peach")
===
--------- end loop =======
    
    counter= 5
elif case in caselist5: #  ['default']
===

#default
print("highest grade");
print("this is a difficult section")

			break

    Massive progress on code generator. Using test data to get it working.
    Dazzling progress. I didn't expect to get this far today.
    Generating case sections now.
    if line and case, body of python code inside and break and fallthru tail.
    and default too. 
    I do my fastest coding in BBedit then use Sublime Text and pydev.
    Fewest indentation bugs with BBedit. 
    For testing using 5 cases initially.
    I changed the design of the appearance of the python to make it simpler
    and more elegant to generate while at the same time generating comments
    so the human reads what they need to read and the computer gets sufficient
    python to do the task.
    
    In my design for speed I added a check for all cases before checking through each
    case at the top where by it will jump to the default cases. I also engineered
    it so that if in the last case it's possible to fallthru to the default. 
    I am a big fan of switch cases so I've duplciated all switch case behavior.
    I hit some walls today but through bulldozer plowering go through the 
    obstacles to make the functions behave the way I want them to.
    
    Listneing to Blade Runner now. Most helpful was Dreamstate Logic - Skies Of Andromeda.

    So overall excellent progress on code generator. 
    
    Sunday, September 6th,2020  1:33pm
    Working on code generator (code name Shark) - should go fast ( I predict)
    Making little pieces of it work and then will connect them together.
    Came up with simpler way to generate the python code so it's less complicated.
    Hit a wall with passing lists but that should be solved now. Passing lists as arguments between functions
    and copying lists. Testing it now.
    Cleaning up last parts of parser which finally started working correctly to get all of the
    necessary information and organize it to make the code gen simple half a page and elegant.
    Again it has to handle n number of cases and everything is unknown up front
    so everything is generated dynamically on-the-fly.
    
    September 3, 2020 6PM Pacific Standard Time
    I will practice with the parts of the code gen now since everything seems ready to feed
    into the codegenerator.
    I will make a skeleton of it later tonight and tomorrow.
    I will then test with C and javascript switch cases with and without braces.
    Oh, the python code inside of a case section is automatically indented by the parser.
    
    Unreal progress today. I have been writing down notes when brainstorming for days and
    then brought it all to reality. Good music helped tremendously today and no interputions.
    Switch case can be any size now and break and fallthrus (explicit and implicit) work and are
    managed automatically. The parser will be at most one page but I'm at 3,000 lines of code for the
    parser and analyzer setting up the data for the codegen to take in input. 
    I will document the magic before positing it for those that care more about the code secrets than
    actaully using the Python beautiful switch case. 
    
    Let's see what else did I work on today. Fallthru is automated and just need to finish a few more lines
    of code for fallthrus. So I'm assembling this in small components and then will connect them together
    but this way I can manage the complexity. 
    
    First case sections in a list.
    
    Case section list of cases in a list for each case section.
    
    Made the case tail section break or fallthru.
    
    Sept 3 Momentum code working, thrilling.
    In shock it's working. Making the perls and connecting them.
    Very productive today. I'm breathless and in disbelief it's working.
    Good music to get into the coding realm trance. "Dreamstate Logic Skies of Andromeda"
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbbCHWQZ70o
    
    What I'm working on today is the break,fallthru list that will be fed into the 
    tail of each case section for the python bottom of the if for a matching case.
    
    Also got the parser code working to grab the set of cases at the top of each case
    section which are put into a list by case section number. This will
    then be used in Python it looks like this if case in ['word1','word2','word3']:
    The code generator is completely dependent on the data gleaned from the parser.
    
    It seemed trivial initially but I got the list working that has the first case of each
    case section that I use for the fallthru trick. That was a bear. I had to think in a different
    way to figure out how to make that work but got it working. Another victory.
    The engineering into making the fallthru work both implicitly and explicitly was a challenge
    but I just kept attacking it. Elegant solution.

    Steady progress. Working on a few more inputs on parser. 
    Solved a few daunting tasks and weaving together key components.
    I can work on it Thursday and Friday so likely launch by Friday
    if I don't have any more interruptions.
    
    August 27th, 2020
    6:54 am
    I have time to work on it today. Possible launch tonight of switch case. Codegen tonight.
    Codegen designed and just connecting the puzzle pieces and legos (sections).

    I am confident it will all work now that the hardest parts work flawlessly.
    Excellent progress on parser analyzer to get information.
    
    Specifically working on creating list of breaks and fallthroughs
    and looking for missing breaks (started working last night near midnight) and
    then putting them into a list that will be used for the tail of each case section.
    Again, this is much more complicated because it's massively dynamic even making new
    lists and variables on the fly. Lots of parameter passing going on. 
    
    Working on three differnet miniprojects within this project to keep my interested and the parts will
    all work together so that way I stay familiar with the necessary behavior needs of
    each part.
    
    Analyzing the case sections in the parser to prepare info for codegen.
    I make working code and then build a template and make it dynamic.
    Worked 10 hours on it yesterday and 10 hours today.
    Each step getting closer and connecting the parts.
    So after I get something working I make it dynamic so it can handle n number of cases.
    There is a great deal of juggling and management going on to bring it to life.
    This is some of the most beautiful and elegant code I've ever devised. I am quite surprised.
    Going into this project I didn't think it would work so I attacked it going backwards from
    the working Python version of the switch case and that helped open angles of attack.

    It will be ready when it's ready. Which is what Blizzard always says and it's fundamentally a truth 
    in programming. Code always takes twice as long to develop as initially dreamed up. Life gets in the way
    and then of course there are bugs which are humorous but always annoying thorns like running through a field
    and suddenly getting tangled in a barbed wire fence.
    
    I will reduce a great deal of the code with a small standard library of methods to clean it up more.
    The design has changed but it is definitely going to work. Unknown if it will be halloween or thanksgiving 
    before it works since my day job is so time consuming.
    
    It is a lot deeper and more complicated then I first imagined though.
    One step at a time. One function at a time.
    
    
    Saturday August 22nd, 2020
    I was slowed down updating a small search engine database program I made for my friends that<br>
    keep losing their passwords so that ate up 2 hours of my time  Saturday.<br>
    
    11:30pm IT'S GOING TO WORK !!!!!!!<br>

    <br>
    PARTY<br>
    No wonder it was tough.<br>
    I will be able to start the final stages of generator the parser is working. That was not fun.<br>
    <br><br>
    Bridging the conection of gathering the critical info from parser<br>
    and then transferring it to the information center for the code gen.<br>
    The bridge turned out being more difficult so instead of the Golden Gate<br>
    it's more like the Oakland Bay Bridge.<br>
    <br><br>
    The other issue I had was clear cut bugs in Sublime Text so I'm using<br>
    BBEdit again which is my fail safe coding tool with no hiccups and<br>
    no speedbumps. Eclipse(java snail slow) and Pydev are too sluggish, Pycharm is a memory HOG,<br>
    and Anaconda and Spyder are great for stepping through code.<br>
    
    Designed the logic for critical test. Good music matters when coding.<br>
    Progress. So close now.<br>
    The thought of how code will work is one thing,<br>
    the other thing is implimenting it and thinking like the machine.<br>
    It's all just boolean logic loops and ifs but once again<br>
    fuzzy logic saves the day. I have learned that the only way to <br>
    guarantee that the logic is right is with fuzzy logic to cover<br>
    all of the bases.<br>
    <br>
    working out the logic for looking for missing breaks and no fallthrough <br>
    in switch case sections <br>
    finally nailed it to identify missing breaks in each case section. <br>
    what is reallly funny is that when you come down to it; it's all just simple<br>
    boolean logic which is powerful if you weild it carefully and thoughtfully. <br>
    <br>
    I thought through the logic during my break today<br>
    but it wasn't easy to impliment because Python isn't very expressive *yet*<br>
    but I will solve that later for now it looks like JavaScript but works<br>
    Lot of dynamic code generation and lists.<br>
    Translation: I spent the past few days designing code before coding it <br>
    rather than designing it on-the-fly but hit some speed bumps, detours, and <br>
    pecularities in Python. Always obstacles and wrong turns untiil the path is found.<br>
    Really important to test code while writing it before digging a deep well<br>
    going nowhere.<br><br>

    Redesigned CodeGen and improved flow of Parser.<br>
    Victory, it works. What a rush.<br>
    Uploading soon.<br>
    <br>
    August 12th , 2020<br>
    Making steady progress.<br>
   
    Got behavior working copying the code inside of each case in parser of switch case<br>
    and can put it into the python codegen. working model now.<br>
    <br><br>
    Figured out the behavior management of the cases to find missing breaks to add fallthru method<br>
    and made automatic list that is used to go to the next case section in a sequence<br>
    using the main first case of each case set. It also locates breaks and fallthrus inserted.<br>
    <br>
    Attempted to find the missing breaks using strings and then resorted back to lists for more<br>
    control.<br>
    Designed list to hold the sequence of breaks and fallthrus.<br>
    <br>
    Designed debug python feature to modify the parser and codegen for user control.<br>
    <br>
    For speed concerns so the switch isn't parsed and codgened every time (unless changed) added feature<br>
    to paste code into your function below the docstring to increase the speed of the switch case.<br>
    <br><br>
    I used my brother's technique of working on new code chunks outside of the main program to <br>
    get them figured and working before adding them to the code base and that helped along<br>
    with a great deal of music.<br>
    <br><br>
    update August 10th, 2020<br>
    I will add support for curly braces and auto-indentation in the next version.<br>
    Just refined the design for parser and codegen.<br>
    Working exclusively on codegen now.<br>
    
    update August 8th, 2020<br>
    10:49pm Significant progress on parser and codegen. Figured out implicit fallthrough if no break<br>
    # it's difficult to please everybody but I wanted to be able to make implicit fallthrough work so<br>
    # code for the switch case looks exactly like C code and JavaScript code<br>
    # but also please Swift and Go programmers with explicit fallthrough and fallthru (it's all taste)<br>
    # much closer to completion<br>
    # spent most of today working on codegen<br>
    # figured out copying code inside of case sections and putting it into python cases using lists<br>
    # the other day but got side tracked with other speedbumps that consumed time<br>
    # probably a few more days but I know it will work now at least. Now I know why nobody else attempted<br>
    #it or if they did attempt it they didn't getting working. It's more complicated then it seems at first.<br>
    
    Solved some difficult probs and switch case version 1.0 should go up tonight....<br>
   
    5:50 PM Saturday: working on codegen in eclipse/pydev now since I spent minimal time on it thus far and most of my time<br>
    has been spent on the parser in Sublime to grab the information data. Testing, testing, testing.<br>
    It's really exciting seeing the dream starting to work.<br>
    <br><br>
    updated August 5th, 2020<br>
    Made more progress on design and implimentation of code gen for the python switch case. <br>
    Instead of juggling a multitude of variables I envisioned the switch case not as one big chunk of code<br>
    but as several different sections that access different lists of information data from the parser<br>
    this way the solution is more elegant and manageable. I got the idea watching the landing of the Dragon Capsule<br>
    splash landing with the four massive parachutes and the solution just popped into my head.<br>
    <br>
    The other issue is that I'm normally used to writing code for myself and not for others and that<br>
    way there's absolutely no pressure and suddenly it occurred to me that this code could conceivably<br>
    be used by millions though I haven't heard one comment on the Python switch case I made so I realized<br>
    that perhaps when the switch case has the same look and feel as a switch case from JavaScript in C<br>
    and the ability to uses braces and not thinking about indentaiton and to use macros and defmacros<br>
    there will be some appreciation. But mainly I was doing this for myself so that I wouldn't abandon<br>
    Python due to the design decisions that make grappling with Python a pain - such as indentation and no<br>
    switch case and no macros and no gotos. <br>
    <br><br>
    This morning at Stanford playing tennis with my friends I wrote some methods for the code gen<br>
    to handle the inputs for the codegen. The solution seems so simple in hindsight but it was all consuming<br>
    initialy. I clearly underestimated the complexity of it but now I'm moving forward and should see<br>
    it working with different test runs this evening.<br>
    <br>
    For the Braces {  } for smart auto indentation I will add that next because I have battled so many <br>
    pointless indentation errors due to errant spaces. This means code is in a docstring and then parser
    goes through it with fuzzy logic and adds the tabs where they should be so you don't have to.<br>
    <br>
    update August 2nd, 2020<br>
    All features work in a docstring triple quoted as a multiline string var.<br>
    Oh, you can use the word var for variables too - python will never see it but you can.<br>
    And you can use let too.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    goto coming soon.<br>
    It's just like jmp in Assembly and uses labels.<br>
    It's entirely based on the ANSI  C implimentation of goto with labels.<br>
    Just like switch case the contents with goto will be in a doc stringwithin a function<br>
    and then executed as python after translation.<br>
    <br><br>
    macros coming soon<br>
    Based on regular and parameter based macros in C and will use #define<br>
    It is parsed and translated into Python. <br>
    
    #include file/module coming soon <br>
    This is a macro that calls import and works inside of the docstring inside of a function<br>
    <br>
    
    foreach  coming soon<br>
    Already works, cool.<br>
    <br>
    
    do while coming soon.<br>
    already works coming soon.<br>
    <br>
    
    { Braces }<br>
    Coming soon. So much nicer and makes Python code look like REAL CODE too - added bonus.<br>
    use C braces and don't even think of militant indentation - so. you. can. code. faster.<br>
    I hate the required indentation rules that are part of the syntax. So I add the tabs into the <br>
    generated Python code for you.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Wait a minute, what motivated me to do all of this. Well, I heard a Harvard CS lecture about python<br>
    by David Malan  that mentioned everything that Python didn't have (couldn't do) and I thought why not.<br>
    So I wanted to blend Python with JavaScript and C and see how it went. Along the way I was horrified<br>
    by the numerous number of bogus unfair indentation errors and decided I did indeed prefer braces and<br>
    figured out how to do automatic smart indentations - using fuzzy logic.<br>
    I also readon stackoverflow about the desire for a switch case and braces due to the hatred of invisible<br>
    forced straightjacket indentation BS.<br>
    
    <br>
    update August 1st,2020
    
    The switch case code that will be inside of a function is actually inside of a triple quoted docstring<br>
    and is assigned a variable name. It will require a standard structure like from JavaScript on Mozilla's page.<br>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch">JS switch</a>
    <br>
    For total control switch works inside of a separate function to avoid interferance with nested and other switches.<br>
    This JS style switch case code is inside of the long-string is parsed and translated into Python and executed.<br>
    It will be possible to examine the generated Python code otherwise it's hidden.<br>
    There will be a function call to parse and generate the python code followed by an exec(string_name);<br>
    After the string it would look like this: exec(string_name)
    <br><br>
    At this point I will include tha smart-auto-indent but I will add braces in a week or so when I have more time.<br>
    <br>
    "We are only going to fail if we give up." Tron movie quote<br>
    <br>
    Had obscure bug in Sublime with tab button creating spaces which was inexplicable. Found solution on StackOverFlow and fixed<br>
    it by accessing preferences. Bizarre bug that wasted hour of my life. I didn't make the change and I noticed it occurred<br>
    just after the request to buy Sublime (which I will next week) happened and then boom nothing worked.<br>
    Worked on parser and made good progress last night.<br>
    Good insights and solutions to vexing probs.<br>
    Began working again on codegen and it's looking good. It uses lists and strings and fuzzy logic.<br><br>
    Thought long and hard about switch() in C and JavaScript which "behaves" and looks like a method<br>
    and to avoid cross polination between multiple switches decided to have switch behave as a separate block<br>
    which means it will be within a function (def) to keep the code isolated from interference.<br>
    <br><br>
    Testing parser to information analyzer to codegen now. It's all coming together.<br>
    I have tomorrow off so I will likely be uploading the working code to github tomorrow.<br>
    I remember when I first conceived the switch case and wondered if it would actually work.<br>
    I will try it (test it) with all of the methods in the same file and then with import. I will<br>
    also include a user-style-guide in html (and javascript) for using it.<br>
    <br><br>
    The program is doing smart-auto-indent through a template and I will analyze through the lines of Python code<br>
    inside the cases and do the indenting with tabs where necessary.<br>
    I will add support for using braces after it's all working. I don't want to make it overly complicated and<br>
    confusing since not everyone will be drawn to the use of braces peppered into their Python code <br>
    but everyone has different tastes so it will be optional.<br><br>
    
    update July 30th, 2020
    numbers (ints) now work with switch(). So currently switch can take in strings and numbers separately. fallthrough now works for numbers<br>
    including into default.<br>
    Made substantial progress on parser analyzer tonight. I definitely have momentum after some speed bumps.<br>
    Maybe a few more days before I upload the code. It will be worth all of the time and effort. I know it will work and look nice.<br>
    Taking agile development approach and doing unit testing, Smaller elegant functions are better than page long functions.<br>
    Oh, how could I forget, for fallthrough you can use fallthrough or fallthru or have no break and it will work like C and JavaScript.<br>
    Macro for sets like 1 thru 5 works as of right now too.<br>
    macros will look like this: Just as in C  #define (1) thru (5) , [1,2,3,4,5] 
    I decided to go along with Go and Swift with the word fallthrough instead of fallthru as default but decided both will work.<br>
    To keep all interested parties informed I first make the Python code work (in eclipse/pydev)to know it's working and then I mess around with the<br>
    C-ish, JavaScript-ish interface view. <br>
    Also I'm working on the automatic indentation which utilizes smart-auto-indentation using braces {  } which are optional and not mandatory.<br>
    I will work on the fuzzy logic rules and flags for the braces to tabs later tonight and tomorrow.<br>
    <br>
    Everyone has different preferences, likes, and dislikes and I wanted to add some flexibility to this. I expect millions to adopt<br>
    it - if they so wish. 
    
    All real programming languages have a switch case and to be honest this is all a big illusion and it's just Python ifs that are<br>
    really running but it sure looks beautiful. I was reading recently that biologists were using Python and I thought they would like a switch case.<br>
    <br>
    I read the Python arguments for and against a switch case. 
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/
    It's all taste. And when I figure out a fallthru for the dictionary mode<br>
    I will then add dictionary support and function calls. For now to launch this puppy it's strictly ifs for now.<br>
    The true power of C can only be realized when you can do what C does and though I am the last person on earth to support C<br>
    Python is dearly deficient in macros, readability (some Python code looks like Hyrogliphics) and why not make code more readable<br>
    and more understandable to the coders that have to read it and think in it to build amazing code. <br>
    <br>
    Working on parser today.<br>
    <br>
    
    update July 28th, 2020 version 1.0 of Python 3 switch case will be posted likely by Thursday night. massive progress<br>
    on parser and codegen.<br>
    <br>
    update July 22nd, 2020
    Since the Santa Cruz Python Preprocessor name is a mouth full I've decided to rename it JetPack.
    I have made design progress with the parser and the code gen for the switch case.
    The switch case mimics the look and feel of C and JavaScript. Nesting switch cases will work if in functions.
    I figured out dealing with multiple nested loops and having goto work.
    I will put some code up in a few days probably by this weekend with test cases of the working prototype.
    
    update July 18th Added support to use numbers for case matches within a switch case including ranges of number such as 1 thru 10, etc<br>
    and to use math formulas just like in C.<br>
    Also in this interface mode you can comment just like in C with // and /* multi-line */  <br>
    <br>
    
    var exp = 5  #notice you can use var
    
     switch(exp){  <br>
   case 1:<br>
      print("one!\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
         <br>
   case 2 thru 5: <br> #thru is a macro
  
      printf("number between 2 and 5\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 6:<br>
      print("six\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 7 thru 10:<br>
      printf"number between 7 and 10\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   default: <br>
      print("no number match\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
       <br>  
   }<br>
   <br>
    
    update July 17th. I'm optimizing the code and making it so it can handle massively huge switch cases.<br>
    My initial thought was a switch case that is merely one page or less and then it occurred to me that<br>
    someone might have big switch cases so I decided to add the dictionary version.<br>
    I have made considerable progress and the fundamentals work and right now I'm just attaching the parts.<br>
    The python code works using if, elif, else and I will add the dictionary version for more speed so <br>
    this will really be a Beta 2 release first actually.<br>
    I have been spending my time mostly on the parser and code generator. The project grew in complexity<br>
    so I cut it in half (divide and conquor) so that I can manage the complexity so it's two programs now that talk to each other.<br>
    I also was greatly slowed down by indentation errors in python so I'm exclusively using Sublime and left Pydev and eclipse at<br>
    this point. And I have been working on two prototypes using JavaScript to get the logic working and then I'll translate<br>
    it into Python.<br>
    A fair assessment is early August since I'm working full time and can only spend a few hours per day on this project.<br>
    <br>
    
    I will put phase 1 Gold Master up most likely by the end of the month. There will be an import file with methods<br>
    or the methods can just be used in the same file as the switch case if you so choose.<br>
  // switch case will be added by July 15th, 2020. This has been a dream for so long.
  // I had a Python version of switch case working for months but everybody wants it to look like a switch case
  // from C and JavaScript and so do I. The behavior has been tested and it's identical to the JavaScript switch case.
    
  // I am adding each feature of the python preprocessor in stages starting with switch case
  // I will add goto next and smart-auto-indent allowing the use of braces
  //
  // example of C/JavaScript style switch case for Python
  // fallthru works if no break.
  // multiple cases works
  // switch works as a method block within a function
    
  switch (expr) {
    
    case 'Oranges':
      print('Oranges are $0.59 a pound.')
      break
    
    case 'Apples':
      print('Apples are $0.32 a pound.')
      break
    
    case 'Bananas':
      print('Bananas are $0.48 a pound.')
    
    case 'Cherries':
      print('Cherries are $3.00 a pound.')
      break
    
    case 'Mangoes':
    case 'Papayas':
      print('Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound.')
      break
    
    default:
      print('Sorry, we are out of ' + expr + '.')
      break
}

<br>
    goto works but decided to first release switch case.<br>
    goto is mind blowing but the number one complaints about Python are no switch case and F'n indentation requirements.<br>
    goto will be released after switch is posted.<br>
    smart auto-indent is implimented with switch case but is separate but for simplicity I'm including it.<br>
    <br>
    macros from C (works) and Lisp  will be added afterwards depending on my time constraints.<br>
    starting with when, unless, until. <br>
    <br>
    Update on progress. July 6, 2020<br>
    switch case in beta now.<br>
    I have been making daily progress recently and the code is flowing. I have had to solve some difficult<br>
    problems doing things I've never done before in Python that are second nature in JavaScript. But I am relentless.<br>
    I want to see switch case work and look the way it does in JavaScript. I read that many biologists around the world<br>
    are using Python and it made me think that they would be more productive with a sweet "normal" switch case<br>
    and auto-indentation using braces instead of thinking about though blasted spaces and tabs when they have<br>
    absolutely nothing to do with the boolean logic whatsoever and instead represent invisible scope guide posts.<br>
    Braces are second nature to most programmers and are used in C, JavaScript, C++, C#, Swift, BCPL, Go, Rust.<br><br>
    the phase pieces are working just connecting them and testing now.<br>
    Succeeded in accessing variables into longstring and for input of exp into switch<br>
    and then output of switch case behavior into variable after leaving long string with switch.<br>
    working with strings currently and will add functionality for numbers which first implimentation will be as strings.<br>
    Succeeded with dynamic concatentation.<br>
    I already figured out smart auto-indent which requires using braces from JavaScript/C but <br>
    by using  braces the programmer doesn't have to think about indentation whatsoever.<br>
    <br>
    JavaScript switch case style rules using curly braces for automatic indentation.<br>
    Multiple cases allowed.<br>
    Fallthru works with missing break.<br>
    C style comments /* example like this for multiple line */  and //right side of code<br>
    Since C represents purity and truth and is engrained in so many programmers DNA now this morphing was inevitable.<br>
    Working on parser and information to dynamically build switch case in Python which already works.<br>
    Each case is built dynamically within a for loop.
    Decideded to add debugger for programmer for verifying correct switch case code input before parsing into Python.<br>
    I have not done the debugger yet but it will be simple and built in stages to ensure it works.<br>
    two modes first working with if elif else, working on dictionary representation.<br>
    third mode will be switch case in C for blinding speed.<br>
    <br>
    Next phases:<br>
    C style macros.<br>
    do while JavaScript style
    foreach
    <br>
    
    
Update: May 28th, 2020<br>
Making progress added choice for switch case as ifs or dictionary<br>
More progress with goto engine.
Preprocessor macro progress and four pass solution for generating Python<br>
using a combination of templates and code generation via fuzzy logic.<brr>
<br>
Added feature to view/debug the python code before it's executed.<br>
<br>
Currently refining automatic-indent coupled with using braces { } ala C and JavaScript<nr>
so if a programmer doesn't want to think about indentation you don't have to.<nr><nr>
<br>

<nr>
 This will include all updates.<br>
I predict at least another month before the version 1.0 Santa Cruz Preprocessor is live.<br>
The point of using the preprocessor is much more readable code, macros, switch case, do while,
SMART-AUTO-INDENT(for the generated Python), braces, in addition to adding Lisp defmacros to the preprocessor to extend the<br>
language starting with when, unless, until, except, but, loop, nth, first, last, rest, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
To be clear since this approach breaks the rules of Python for the interface<br>
layer the actual code the human writes is within triple quotes and is seen<br>
by python as a string with a name and not as code. It is parsed and put into another string <br>
and then it's executed using exec(stringname) <br>
But while debugging you can see the generated Python code and step through it<br>
if you want to. So nothing is hidden. Everything is more streamlined this way<br>
so you don't have to be bothered by indentation errors and code in a more<br>
readable format than what Python allows. So python only sees python and not<br>
this higher level pre-processor level. <br>
The other issue is using braces {   } and not thinking of indentation constraints<br>
so you can code more naturally. The resulting python won't have any braces.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Example switch case you will be able to write in Python at the preprocessor level
You can use semicolons and curly braces.<br> I will also write a version to
do the switch case in C which I will add much later this summer. First in Cython.<br>
Fall thru will work and the switch case can be any size.<br>
<br>
<br>

 switch(grade){  <br>
   case 'A':<br>
      print("Excellent!\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
         <br>
   case 'B': <br>
   case 'C':<br>
      printf("Well done\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 'D':<br>
      print("You passed\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 'F':<br>
      printf"Better try again\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   default: <br>
      print("Invalid grade\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
       <br>  
   }<br>
   <br>

<br>
I was inspired by the philosophy of Guido van Rossum taking ideas from other languages.
<br>
Santa Cruz Python Preprocessor Under Development<br>
translates into Python.<br>
The code is drool worthy and much cleaner and more readable. <br>
<br>
<b>Note: when I say "from C" that means inspired by C code's look and behavior.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Ideas came from C and Lisp and what I wanted to speed<br>
up programming in Python and reduce bugs.<br>
<br><br>
use braces to your heart's delight<br>
<br>
switch case from C<br>
as many levels of nested switch cases as you want (put them in functions)<br>
do while from C<br>
gotos and labels from C<br>
Languages with goto: PL/1, Fortran, Ada, C, C++, C#.<br>

#define macros from C<br>
#defmacro from Lisp<br>
#include "filename" from C
Adding loop, when, until, unless, bypass, override, next, ..and more

<br><br>
auto-indentation (it was a necessity) <br>
I really got sick of Indentation errors tripping me up.<br>

<br><br>
everything works, just cleaning up the code<br>
