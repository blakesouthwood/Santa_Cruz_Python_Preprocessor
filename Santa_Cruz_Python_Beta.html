	Looks like switch case code will be fully operational today and posted here tonight.
	First launching with if version and will add dictionary version in a few days after.
	Using a flag the user can choose how they want any particular switch to be created
	#use ifs
	#use dictionary  placed at top of switch code
	
	This is a pivitol moment. Very exciting. 
	Everything should be working this afternoon.
