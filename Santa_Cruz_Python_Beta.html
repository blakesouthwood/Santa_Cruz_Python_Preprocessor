	switch case alpha and beta testing. First attempt worked at 6:03 am this morning. Persaverance. Dogged determination.
	Alpha testing copied output from parser and codegen and pasted it into pydev and ran it.
	Fixed some initial bugs and then it ran. Unreal.
	Beta testing: it works.
	Polishing up and documenting code now
	Thrilled beyond belief.
	First successful test fully operational.

	Looks like switch case code will be fully operational today and posted here tonight.
	First launching with if version and will add dictionary version in a few days after.
	Using a flag the user can choose how they want any particular switch to be created
	#use ifs
	#use dictionary  placed at top of switch code
	
	This is a pivitol moment. Very exciting. 
	Everything should be working this afternoon.
