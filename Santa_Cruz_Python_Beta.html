	Testing code generator right now. I spent inordinate time buiding smart tab engine
	and then decided on a simpler and more elegant solution so the tabs used by the user
	to write their case section code are used for the Python code.
	Sample output of generated Python code just put together today on my tight schedule.
	I had to put immense thought into this to make the output as minimal as possible so it
	would look clean and at the same time accommodate everything. This is the string version.
	Redoing number version for switch which will go up later. 
	
	Curently testing after battlling narly bugs. This is sample output of the generated python code
	that will be in a string and then executed but it can also be written to a file and then executed
	if someone is so inclined. 
	
	I will have more time to document everything and put the code up on github between Oct 23rd - 27th.
	
	
	caselist1 = ['apple', 'money']
	caselist2 = ['bananas', 'coconuts', 'strawberries', 'tangerines']
	caselist3 = ['chocolate', 'marsbar']
	caselist4 = ['fish', 'peanuts']
	caselist5 = ['default']


	#list input varholder=[] must be above function with switch
	varholder.append(exp)
	case = varholder[0]
	exp  = varholder[0]


	switch(exp)
	while True:

		if case in caselist1:
			print('first case')
			print('testing')
			fallthru('bananas')

		elif case in caselist2:
			print('second case')
			print('testing')
			fallthru('chocolate')

		elif case in caselist3:
			print('third case')
			print('testing')
			fallthru('cherries')

		elif case in caselist4:
			print('fourth case')
			print('testing')
			break

		elif case in caselist5:
			print('fifth case')
			print('testing')
			break

		elif case in caselist6:
			print('default case')  #this default case is used if someone wants to fallthru to default
			print('default')
			break

		else:
			print('default case')
			print('default')
			break

	switch case alpha and beta testing. First attempt worked at 6:03 am this morning. Persaverance. Dogged determination.
	Alpha testing copied output from parser and codegen and pasted it into pydev and ran it.
	Fixed some initial bugs and then it ran. Unreal.
	Beta testing: it works.
	Polishing up and documenting code now
	Thrilled beyond belief.
	First successful test fully operational.
	Now I need to do more thorough testing but the rush of it working has hit me like a tidal wave.
	Will release goto and do while and macros soon and conditionals when,unless,until.

	Looks like switch case code will be fully operational today and posted here tonight.
	First launching with if version and will add dictionary version in a few days after.
	Using a flag the user can choose how they want any particular switch to be created
	#use ifs
	#use dictionary  placed at top of switch code
	
	This is a pivitol moment. Very exciting. 
	Everything should be working this afternoon.
