	## =============
	November 26, 2020 Silicon Valley, California
	The file is called beta_switchcase.py and it is running but outputs a great deal of information which I have
	been using for debugging. This is the most complex project I've ever done in Python in 2 years.
	I have been working on and off on this project for a year now.
	
	It's thanksgiving day. I will rename most of the variables and functions in the next week and make
	the documentation neat and tidy and include a user manual.
	
	I am currently working on the indentation for the output string of generated python code which was beautiful
	and then on pydev I learned that to execute it (the python switch case ) it has to be jammed against the left
	side and the indentation tab count is -1 based  so in the initial docstring the tabs are captured and
	then for the output the formatting for the switch and cases is less than the initial set up.
	
	
	
	I had an emergency and nearly lost the code so though it's not golden master yet and I'm still writing
	the documentation. I'm putting the code up for the switch case. It's dense. I will clean it up within the
	next few days but by putting it on github I won'nt have to worry about losing it.
	So it's in beta. I'm reengineering a few aspects so that it runs flawlessly. 
	I have tested the output and it works but isn't seamless yet.
	It's in one file.
	
	
	I realized that since others might use this Python switch case that convenience would be imperative so it was 
	initially in about 10 files and now it's all in one file which would require just one import.
	
	November 25th, 2020. I was just fixing some nontrivial bugs and then my jaw dropped and I uttered  the words.
	"Oh my god it works."
	Trying more cases. Making the documentation pretty. I thought getting it to fully work would take the next two days
	but it seems to be running perfectly currently. Might upload tonight still cleaning up code.
	What a thrill. Taking out the scaffolding and print statements.
	
	
	November 22nd, 2020. It works.
	It's stable. It's sweet. It's surreal. Total rush. Uploading tonight.
	Think of it as hybrid Python because you can break the rules and do the extraordinary with ease.
	This is just the beginning of adding serious power and coding speed and increased readability to Python.
	
	Adding documentation and moved it all into one file.
	Beta testing to try all possible scenarios.
	Tested generated code and it worked.
	Definitely uploading the codebase tonight since I have today off.
	
	The last bug was the default case.
	
	
	Likely a few more days but the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter.
	Made massive backups. 
	The bug is the loop and inconsistent numbers of items in the lists.
	Will tip toe through my setup with the dummy data and compare it with the real day
	that flows into it. Will use range() for the loop to avoid the index out of range error.
	
	11pm. Testing, bugs in code gen, doing more testing for correctness. 
	After more testing and clean documenation I will upload it.
	Spent time on executing the generated python. Spent time figuring out how to do
	nested switch cases within a switch case.
	
	
	November 17th. Code stable. Uploading switch case tonight after I get off work.
	Nested switch cases works! so far one level down but it's a start.
	The inner_switch is within a function to prevent interference.
	It looks like this:  inner_switch('test1'). Coded it in ten minutes for fun and it worked. Just tested it.
	Every comment on stackoverflow and quora begs for a switch with nesting switches. 
	Just realized that at the inteface level it will appear 
	as switch('test1') so I can convert it to inner_switch('exp') in the parser.
	Therefore it will look like this: (just lke in lovely C code).
	
	Was just reviewing C code and the example showed a completely embedded switch within 
	the outter main switch and I can parse it written like it is in C with the switch fully shown
	and then I can put it into a function to make it work in Python. 
	I will code this later. Right now getting the regular switch case up on the web.
	
	switch(grade) 
		case 'apple':  #first input x
		case 'money':
			print(\"first  section!\");
			switch("test1")
			break
	
	
	
	So far pared the project down to 2,700 lines of code for the parser. The generator is just 75 lines.
	Also have C comments working, macros, and goto label (looks and works just like in C ). Will add in next version.

	switch case going up today and if not then by halloween.
	Working on it right now for final testing. Putting the four modules together
	and taking out unused code.
	Tested with strings and numbers - looks good.
	goto label going up next which works using this switch case.
	
	Exciting to fulfill a dream.
	
	
	Oct 25th, 2020
	Putting pieces together and have been refactoring to reduce the code base.
	Falling through cases can be done implicitly with no break or explicitly with fallthru or fallthrough
	Doing testing with C switch cases now to verify the behavior is identical to C when done with Python 3.
	Decided to add C comments testing,(it works) not impimented yet.
	/*
	  example C comment
	  because I just like them
	*/
	
	// and comments like this on separate line
	
	#both are converted to this format
	
	
	
	October 16th, 2020
	Testing code generator right now. I spent inordinate time buiding the smart tab engine
	and then decided on a simpler and more elegant solution so the tabs used by the user
	to write their case section code are used for the Python code.
	Sample output of generated Python code just put together today on my tight schedule.
	I had to put immense thought into this to make the output as minimal as possible so it
	would look clean and at the same time accommodate everything. This is the string version.
	Redoing number version for switch which will go up later. 
	
	Currently testing after battling narly bugs. This is some sample output of the generated python code
	that will be in a string and then executed but it can also be written to a file and then executed
	if someone is so inclined. So the code that is generated you won't actually see but if you have bugs
	I devised a way to edit it and debug it.
	
	I will have more time to document everything and put the code up on github between Oct 23rd - 27th.
	
	
	caselist1 = ['apple', 'money']
	caselist2 = ['bananas', 'coconuts', 'strawberries', 'tangerines']
	caselist3 = ['chocolate', 'marsbar']
	caselist4 = ['fish', 'peanuts']
	caselist5 = ['default']


	#list input varholder=[] must be above function with switch
	
	case = varholder[0]
	exp  = varholder[0]


	switch(exp)
	while True:

		if case in caselist1:
			print('first case')
			print('testing')
			fallthru('bananas')

		elif case in caselist2:
			print('second case')
			print('testing')
			fallthru('chocolate')

		elif case in caselist3:
			print('third case')
			print('testing')
			fallthru('cherries')

		elif case in caselist4:
			print('fourth case')
			print('testing')
			break

		elif case in caselist5:
			print('fifth case')
			print('testing')
			break

		elif case in caselist6:
			print('default case')  #this default case is used if someone wants to fallthru to default
			print('default')
			break

		else:
			print('default case')
			print('default')
			break

	switch case alpha and beta testing. First attempt worked at 6:03 am this morning. Persaverance. Dogged determination.
	Alpha testing copied output from parser and codegen and pasted it into pydev and ran it.
	Fixed some initial bugs and then it ran. Unreal.
	Beta testing: it works.
	Polishing up and documenting code now
	Thrilled beyond belief.
	First successful test fully operational.
	Now I need to do more thorough testing but the rush of it working has hit me like a tidal wave.
	Will release goto and do while and macros soon and conditionals when,unless,until.

	September 17th, 2020
	Looks like switch case code will be fully operational today and posted here tonight.
	First launching with if version and will add dictionary version in a few days after.
	Using a flag the user can choose how they want any particular switch to be created
	#use ifs
	#use dictionary  placed at top of switch code
	
	This is a pivitol moment. Very exciting. 
	Everything should be working this afternoon.
