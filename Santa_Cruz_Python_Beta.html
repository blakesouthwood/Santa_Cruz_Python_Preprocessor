    update August 1st,2020
    
    The switch case code that will be inside of a function is actually inside of a triple quoted docstring<br>
    and is assigned a variable name. It will require a standard structure like from JavaScript on Mozilla's page.<br>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch">JS switch</a>
    <br>
    This JS style switch case code is inside of the long-string is parsed and translated into Python and executed.<br>
    It will be possible to examine the generated Python code otherwise it's hidden.<br>
    There will be a function call to parse and generate the python code followed by an exec(string_name);<br>
    After the string it would look like this: exec(string_name)
    <br><br>
    At this point I will include tha smart-auto-indent but I will add braces in a week or so when I have more time.<br>
    <br>
    "We are only going to fail if we give up." Ton movie quote<br>
    Had obscure bug in Sublime with tab button creating spaces which was inexplicable. Found solution on StackOverFlow and fixed<br>
    it by accessing preferences. Bizarre bug that wasted hour of my life. I didn't make the change and I noticed it occurred<br>
    just after the request to buy Sublime (which I will next week) happened and then boom nothing worked.<br>
    Worked on parser and made good progress last night.<br>
    Good insights and solutions to vexing probs.<br>
    Began working again on codegen and it's looking good. It uses lists and strings and fuzzy logic.<br><br>
    Thought long and hard about switch() in C and JavaScript which "behaves" and looks like a method<br>
    and to avoid cross polination between multiple switches decided to have switch behave as a separate block<br>
    which means it will be within a function (def) to keep the code isolated from interference.<br>
    <br><br>
    Testing parser to information analyzer to codegen now. It's all coming together.<br>
    I have tomorrow off so I will likely be uploading the working code to github tomorrow.<br>
    I remember when I first conceived the switch case and wondered if it would actually work.<br>
    I will try it (test it) with all of the methods in the same file and then with import. I will<br>
    also include a user-style-guide in html (and javascript) for using it.<br>
    <br><br>
    The program is doing smart-auto-indent through a template and I will analyze through the lines of Python code<br>
    inside the cases and do the indenting with tabs where necessary.<br>
    I will add support for using braces after it's all working. I don't want to make it overly complicated and<br>
    confusing since not everyone will be drawn to the use of braces peppered into their Python code <br>
    but everyone has different tastes so it will be optional.<br><br>
    
    update July 30th, 2020
    numbers (ints) now work with switch(). So currently switch can take in strings and numbers separately. fallthrough now works for numbers<br>
    including into default.<br>
    Made substantial progress on parser analyzer tonight. I definitely have momentum after some speed bumps.<br>
    Maybe a few more days before I upload the code. It will be worth all of the time and effort. I know it will work and look nice.<br>
    Taking agile development approach and doing unit testing, Smaller elegant functions are better than page long functions.<br>
    Oh, how could I forget, for fallthrough you can use fallthrough or fallthru or have no break and it will work like C and JavaScript.<br>
    Macro for sets like 1 thru 5 works as of right now too.<br>
    macros will look like this: Just as in C  #define (1) thru (5) , [1,2,3,4,5] 
    I decided to go along with Go and Swift with the word fallthrough instead of fallthru as default but decided both will work.<br>
    To keep all interested parties informed I first make the Python code work (in eclipse/pydev)to know it's working and then I mess around with the<br>
    C-ish, JavaScript-ish interface view. <br>
    Also I'm working on the automatic indentation which utilizes smart-auto-indentation using braces {  } which are optional and not mandatory.<br>
    I will work on the fuzzy logic rules and flags for the braces to tabs later tonight and tomorrow.<br>
    <br>
    Everyone has different preferences, likes, and dislikes and I wanted to add some flexibility to this. I expect millions to adopt<br>
    it - if they so wish. I recently read Snowden and saw the movie and thought about the implications of having a real (or imagined) switch case in Python<br>
    which many (the pythonic die hards) won't use- their loss - and everyone else - it's just Python running - but I wanted to<br>
    save time, make the code look like it should look like (though this is highly subjective). Many will call it syntactic sugar - but so go use Scratch or Alice then.<br>
    The other issue that crossed my mind was if this is such a bad thing and will it be used for nefarious things - not my problem. <br>
    All real programming languages have a switch case and to be honest this is all a big illusion and it's just Python ifs that are<br>
    really running but it sure looks beautiful. I was reading recently that biologists were using Python and I thought they would like a switch case.<br>
    <br>
    I read the Python arguments for and against a switch case. 
    https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3103/
    It's all taste. And when I figure out a fallthru for the dictionary mode<br>
    I will then add dictionary support and function calls. For now to launch this puppy it's strictly ifs for now.<br>
    The true power of C can only be realized when you can do what C does and though I am the last person on earth to support C<br>
    Python is dearly deficient in macros, readability (some Python code looks like Hyrogliphics) and why not make code more readable<br>
    and more understandable to the coders that have to read it and think in it to build amazing code. <br>
    <br>
    Working on parser today.<br>
    <br>
    
    update July 28th, 2020 version 1.0 of Python 3 switch case will be posted likely by Thursday night. massive progress<br>
    on parser and codegen.<br>
    <br>
    update July 22nd, 2020
    Since the Santa Cruz Python Preprocessor name is a mouth full I've decided to rename it JetPack.
    I have made design progress with the parser and the code gen for the switch case.
    The switch case mimics the look and feel of C and JavaScript. Nesting switch cases will work if in functions.
    I figured out dealing with multiple nested loops and having goto work.
    I will put some code up in a few days probably by this weekend with test cases of the working prototype.
    
    update July 18th Added support to use numbers for case matches within a switch case including ranges of number such as 1 thru 10, etc<br>
    and to use math formulas just like in C.<br>
    Also in this interface mode you can comment just like in C with // and /* multi-line */  <br>
    <br>
    
    var exp = 5  #notice you can use var
    
     switch(exp){  <br>
   case 1:<br>
      print("one!\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
         <br>
   case 2 thru 5: <br> #thru is a macro
  
      printf("number between 2 and 5\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 6:<br>
      print("six\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 7 thru 10:<br>
      printf"number between 7 and 10\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   default: <br>
      print("no number match\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
       <br>  
   }<br>
   <br>
    
    update July 17th. I'm optimizing the code and making it so it can handle massively huge switch cases.<br>
    My initial thought was a switch case that is merely one page or less and then it occurred to me that<br>
    someone might have big switch cases so I decided to add the dictionary version.<br>
    I have made considerable progress and the fundamentals work and right now I'm just attaching the parts.<br>
    The python code works using if, elif, else and I will add the dictionary version for more speed so <br>
    this will really be a Beta 2 release first actually.<br>
    I have been spending my time mostly on the parser and code generator. The project grew in complexity<br>
    so I cut it in half (divide and conquor) so that I can manage the complexity so it's two programs now that talk to each other.<br>
    I also was greatly slowed down by indentation errors in python so I'm exclusively using Sublime and left Pydev and eclipse at<br>
    this point. And I have been working on two prototypes using JavaScript to get the logic working and then I'll translate<br>
    it into Python.<br>
    A fair assessment is early August since I'm working full time and can only spend a few hours per day on this project.<br>
    <br>
    
    I will put phase 1 Gold Master up most likely by the end of the month. There will be an import file with methods<br>
    or the methods can just be used in the same file as the switch case if you so choose.<br>
  // switch case will be added by July 15th, 2020. This has been a dream for so long.
  // I had a Python version of switch case working for months but everybody wants it to look like a switch case
  // from C and JavaScript and so do I. The behavior has been tested and it's identical to the JavaScript switch case.
    
  // I am adding each feature of the python preprocessor in stages starting with switch case
  // I will add goto next and smart-auto-indent allowing the use of braces
  //
  // example of C/JavaScript style switch case for Python
  // fallthru works if no break.
  // multiple cases works
  // switch works as a method block within a function
    
  switch (expr) {
    
    case 'Oranges':
      print('Oranges are $0.59 a pound.')
      break
    
    case 'Apples':
      print('Apples are $0.32 a pound.')
      break
    
    case 'Bananas':
      print('Bananas are $0.48 a pound.')
    
    case 'Cherries':
      print('Cherries are $3.00 a pound.')
      break
    
    case 'Mangoes':
    case 'Papayas':
      print('Mangoes and papayas are $2.79 a pound.')
      break
    
    default:
      print('Sorry, we are out of ' + expr + '.')
      break

Posted May 14th, 2020 by Blake Southwood.<br>
<br>
    goto works but decided to first release switch case.<br>
    goto is mind blowing but the number one complaints about Python are no switch case and F'n indentation requirements.<br>
    goto will be released after switch is posted.<br>
    smart auto-indent is implimented with switch case but is separate but for simplicity I'm including it.<br>
    <br>
    macros from C (works) and Lisp  will be added afterwards depending on my time constraints.<br>
    starting with when, unless, until. <br>
    <br>
    Update on progress. July 6, 2020<br>
    switch case in beta now.<br>
    I have been making daily progress recently and the code is flowing. I have had to solve some difficult<br>
    problems doing things I've never done before in Python that are second nature in JavaScript. But I am relentless.<br>
    I want to see switch case work and look the way it does in JavaScript. I read that many biologists around the world<br>
    are using Python and it made me think that they would be more productive with a sweet "normal" switch case<br>
    and auto-indentation using braces instead of thinking about though blasted spaces and tabs when they have<br>
    absolutely nothing to do with the boolean logic whatsoever and instead represent invisible scope guide posts.<br>
    Braces are second nature to most programmers and are used in C, JavaScript, C++, C#, Swift, BCPL, Go, Rust.<br><br>
    the phase pieces are working just connecting them and testing now.<br>
    Succeeded in accessing variables into longstring and for input of exp into switch<br>
    and then output of switch case behavior into variable after leaving long string with switch.<br>
    working with strings currently and will add functionality for numbers which first implimentation will be as strings.<br>
    Succeeded with dynamic concatentation.<br>
    I already figured out smart auto-indent which requires using braces from JavaScript/C but <br>
    by using  braces the programmer doesn't have to think about indentation whatsoever.<br>
    <br>
    JavaScript switch case style rules using curly braces for automatic indentation.<br>
    Multiple cases allowed.<br>
    Fallthru works with missing break.<br>
    C style comments /* example like this for multiple line */  and //right side of code<br>
    Since C represents purity and truth and is engrained in so many programmers DNA now this morphing was inevitable.<br>
    Working on parser and information to dynamically build switch case in Python which already works.<br>
    Each case is built dynamically within a for loop.
    Decideded to add debugger for programmer for verifying correct switch case code input before parsing into Python.<br>
    I have not done the debugger yet but it will be simple and built in stages to ensure it works.<br>
    two modes first working with if elif else, working on dictionary representation.<br>
    third mode will be switch case in C for blinding speed.<br>
    <br>
    Next phases:<br>
    C style macros.<br>
    do while JavaScript style
    foreach
    <br>
    
    
Update: May 28th, 2020<br>
Making progress added choice for switch case as ifs or dictionary<br>
More progress with goto engine.
Preprocessor macro progress and four pass solution for generating Python<br>
using a combination of templates and code generation via fuzzy logic.<brr>
<br>
Added feature to view/debug the python code before it's executed.<br>
<br>
Currently refining automatic-indent coupled with using braces { } ala C and JavaScript<nr>
so if a programmer doesn't want to think about indentation you don't have to.<nr><nr>
<br>
Working on debugger checking syntax before conversion.<br>
With smart breakpoint with step thru feature<br>
<nr>
I need a car and I'm dirt poor so I decided to seek funding for this software.<br><br>
Taking pre-orders for license of use of this software<br> You can wait till it's golden
master but development will be accelerated with funds. This will include all updates.<br>
I predict at least another month before the version 1.0 Santa Cruz Preprocessor is live.<br>
The point of using the preprocessor is much more readable code, macros, switch case, do while,
SMART-AUTO-INDENT(for the generated Python), braces, in addition to adding Lisp defmacros to the preprocessor to extend the<br>
language starting with when, unless, until, except, but, loop, nth, first, last, rest, etc.<br>

<br>
To be clear since this approach breaks the rules of Python for the interface<br>
layer the actual code the human writes is within triple quotes and is seen<br>
by python as a string with a name and not as code. It is parsed and put into another string <br>
and then it's executed using exec(stringname) <br>
But while debugging you can see the generated Python code and step through it<br>
if you want to. So nothing is hidden. Everything is more streamlined this way<br>
so you don't have to be bothered by indentation errors and code in a more<br>
readable format than what Python allows. So python only sees python and not<br>
this higher level pre-processor level. <br>
The other issue is using braces {   } and not thinking of indentation constraints<br>
so you can code more naturally. The resulting python won't have any braces.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Example switch case you will be able to write in Python at the preprocessor level
You can use semicolons and curly braces.<br> I will also write a version to
do the switch case in C which I will add much later this summer. First in Cython.<br>
Fall thru will work and the switch case can be any size.<br>
<br>
<br>

 switch(grade){  <br>
   case 'A':<br>
      print("Excellent!\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
         <br>
   case 'B': <br>
   case 'C':<br>
      printf("Well done\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 'D':<br>
      print("You passed\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 'F':<br>
      printf"Better try again\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   default: <br>
      print("Invalid grade\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
       <br>  
   }<br>
   <br>

<br>
I was inspired by the philosophy of Guido van Rossum taking ideas from other languages.
<br>
Santa Cruz Python Preprocessor Under Development<br>
translates into Python.<br>
The code is drool worthy and much cleaner and more readable. <br>
<br>
<b>Note: when I say "from C" that means inspired by C code's look and behavior.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Ideas came from C and Lisp and what I wanted to speed<br>
up programming in Python and reduce bugs.<br>
<br><br>
use braces to your heart's delight<br>
<br>
switch case from C<br>
as many levels of nested switch cases as you want (put them in functions)<br>
do while from C<br>
gotos and labels from C<br>
Languages with goto: PL/1, Fortran, Ada, C, C++, C#.<br>

#define macros from C<br>
#defmacro from Lisp<br>
#include "filename" from C
Adding loop, when, until, unless, bypass, override, next, ..and more

<br><br>
auto-indentation (it was a necessity) <br>
I really got sick of Indentation errors tripping me up.<br>

<br><br>
everything works, just cleaning up the code<br>
