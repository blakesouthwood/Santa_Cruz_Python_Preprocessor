Santa Cruz Preprocessor Additions to Python in Beta 1.2<br>
Project Code Name: TRON<br>
Posted May 14th, 2020 by Blake Southwood.<br>
<br>
    Update on progress. July 6, 2020<br>
    switch case in beta now.<br>
    the phase pieces are working just connecting them and testing now.<br>
    Succeeded in accessing variables into longstring and for input of exp into switch<br>
    and then output of switch case behavior into variable after leaving long string with switch.<br>
    workings with strings currently and will add functionality for numbers which first implimentation will be as strings.<br>
    Succeeded with dynamic concatentation.<br>
    I already figured out smart auto-indent which requires using braces from JavaScript/C but <br>
    by using  braces the programmer doesn't have to think about indentation whatsoever.<br>
    <br>
    JavaScript switch case style rules using curly braces for automatic indentation.<br>
    Multiple cases allowed.<br>
    Fallthru works with missing break.<br>
    Working on parser and information to dynamically buiuld switch case in Python.<br>
    two modes first working with if elif else, working on dictionary representation.<br>
    third mode will be switch case in C for blinding speed.<br>
    <br>
    Next phases:<br>
    C style macros.<br>
    do while JavaScript style
    foreach
    <br>
    
    
Update: May 28th, 2020<br>
Making progress added choice for switch case as ifs or dictionary<br>
More progress with goto engine.
Preprocessor macro progress and four pass solution for generating Python<br>
using a combination of templates and code generation via fuzzy logic.<brr>
<br>
Added feature to view/debug the python code before it's executed.<br>
<br>
Currently refining automatic-indent coupled with using braces { } ala C and JavaScript<nr>
so if a programmer doesn't want to think about indentation you don't have to.<nr><nr>
<br>
Working on debugger checking syntax before conversion.<br>
With smart breakpoint with step thru feature<br>
<nr>
I need a car and I'm dirt poor so I decided to seek funding for this software.<br><br>
Taking pre-orders for license of use of this software<br> You can wait till it's golden
master but development will be accelerated with funds. This will include all updates.<br>
I predict at least another month before the version 1.0 Santa Cruz Preprocessor is live.<br>
The point of using the preprocessor is much more readable code, macros, switch case, do while,
SMART-AUTO-INDENT(for the generated Python), braces, in addition to adding Lisp defmacros to the preprocessor to extend the<br>
language starting with when, unless, until, except, but, loop, nth, first, last, rest, etc.<br>

<br>
To be clear since this approach breaks the rules of Python for the interface<br>
layer the actual code the human writes is within triple quotes and is seen<br>
by python as a string with a name and not as code. It is parsed and put into another string <br>
and then it's executed using exec(stringname) <br>
But while debugging you can see the generated Python code and step through it<br>
if you want to. So nothing is hidden. Everything is more streamlined this way<br>
so you don't have to be bothered by indentation errors and code in a more<br>
readable format than what Python allows. So python only sees python and not<br>
this higher level pre-processor level. <br>
The other issue is using braces {   } and not thinking of indentation constraints<br>
so you can code more naturally. The resulting python won't have any braces.<br>
<br><br>
<br>
Example switch case you will be able to write in Python at the preprocessor level
You can use semicolons and curly braces.<br> I will also write a version to
do the switch case in C which I will add much later this summer. First in Cython.<br>
Fall thru will work and the switch case can be any size.<br>
<br>
<br>

 switch(grade){  <br>
   case 'A':<br>
      print("Excellent!\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
         <br>
   case 'B': <br>
   case 'C':<br>
      printf("Well done\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 'D':<br>
      print("You passed\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   case 'F':<br>
      printf"Better try again\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
     <br>
   default: <br>
      print("Invalid grade\n" );<br>
      break;<br>
       <br>  
   }<br>
   <br>

<br>
I was inspired by the philosophy of Guido van Rossum taking ideas from other languages.
<br>
Santa Cruz Python Preprocessor Under Development<br>
translates into Python.<br>
The code is drool worthy and much cleaner and more readable. <br>
<br>
<b>Note: when I say "from C" that means inspired by C code's look and behavior.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Ideas came from C and Lisp and what I wanted to speed<br>
up programming in Python and reduce bugs.<br>
<br><br>
use braces to your heart's delight<br>
<br>
switch case from C<br>
as many levels of nested switch cases as you want (put them in functions)<br>
do while from C<br>
gotos and labels from C<br>
Languages with goto: PL/1, Fortran, Ada, C, C++, C#.<br>

#define macros from C<br>
#defmacro from Lisp<br>
#include "filename" from C
Adding loop, when, until, unless, bypass, override, next, ..and more

<br><br>
auto-indentation (it was a necessity) <br>
I really got sick of Indentation errors tripping me up.<br>

<br><br>
everything works, just cleaning up the code<br>
