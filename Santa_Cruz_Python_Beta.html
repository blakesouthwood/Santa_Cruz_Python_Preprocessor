Santa Cruz Preprocessor Additions to Python in Beta 1.2<br>
Posted May 14th, 2020 by Blake Southwood.<br>
<br>
I was inspired by the philosophy of Guido van Rossum taking ideas from other languages.
<br>
Santa Cruz Python Preprocessor Under Development<br>
translates into Python.<br>
The code is drool worthy and much cleaner and more readable. <br>
<br>
<b>Note: when I say "from C" that means inspired by C code's look and behavior</b><br>
<br>
<br>
Ideas came from C and Lisp and what I wanted to speed<br>
up programming in Python and reduce bugs.<br>
<br><br>
use braces to your heart's delight<br>
<br>
switch case from C<br>
as many levels of nested switch cases as you want (put them in functions)<br>
do while from C<br>
gotos and labels from C<br>
Languages with goto: PL/1, Fortran, Ada, C, C++, C#.<br>

#define macros from C<br>
#defmacro from Lisp<br>
#include "filename" from C
Adding loop, when, until, unless, bypass, override, next, ..and more

<br><br>
auto-indentation (it was a necessity) <br>
I really got sick of Indentation errors tripping me up.<br>

<br><br>
everything works, just cleaning up the code<br>
