Summary: designed and built parser and code generator in python that reads 
JavaScript switch case code and converts it into Python. The switch case
project code name Tron is the biggest software project I have ever attempted.
I made sure to modularize it and it was 20 smaller programs that I built separately and then connected them
together gradually.

Next I will add goto label and lisp macros when, unless, until.

Recent Experience:
HTML, JavaScript, Python
Designed switch case for Python in Python.
https://github.com/blakesouthwood/Python-Switch-Case/blob/master/switch_case.py

Designed Parser and Codegen to make it possible to write a C style switch
case with words or numbers that is converted into Python code.
This project is nearly finished. It is blossomed into a preprocessor for
Python so macros work. First version of codegen took a day and then two to three
days to get it to actually behave correctly.

Log of current progress on the switch case.
https://github.com/blakesouthwood/Santa_Cruz_Python_Preprocessor/blob/master/angel_falls.py

Once the switch case is stable I can easily make a goto label using it also.

This shows the switch interface with C code but with Python tabs.

This is the module with the switch module code still under development.

My current project is a preprocessor for Python implimenting a true switch case based on C's
switch case behavior. The switch case is now (nearly) stable and next I will add goto label.
I also have macros working. I will add smart-auto indentation and braces next.

The switch case is currently being debugged after refactoring to make 
it more efficient. I added numerous methods to make the code more readable
and to facilitate greater development speed.

Last year I wrote the beginning of SQL search for JavaScript in JavaScript
Client side that uses and or not for searches. It was a thrill when it first worked.

This is a Replay what a program in JavaScript did, by using a log file
to be able to navigate through the whole program.

I made this reverse dictionary in JavaScript a while back.

I made a site for the iphone for a friend in Germany that 
was essentially a video juke box and shopping for shirts and hats.

This has the code for the video juke box for changing videos on the fly
that utilizes links to YouTube.

I made a small library of methods in a few days while visiting my oldest
brother in LA a year ago.

The first program I made in Python was for analzying my mother's poetry.

I did tic tac toe in JavaScript.

I coded this in one hour to test myself.

Past Coding Experience:
Franklin Templeton, San Mateo, California 1998-2000  
I was a fund info rep talking to New York Brokers. I wrote code in JavaScript at home to make my job easier. 
I was a fund info rep at Franklin Templeton and their information system
was archaic so I taught myself JavaScript at night and automated all financial 
calculations. (This was my first designing complexity experience).
I accidentally chanced on this approach building small programs that were
coralled together yet worked independently. All future projects were based
on this approach along with testing and reviews from users.
I designed and implimented a collosal web based system to automate
all financial calculations combined with a real-time ram based
database search engine for Franklin Templeton in HTML and JavaScript that
Franklin Templeton in San Mateo, California ultimately approved through their 
compliance. A co-worker wrote me that "she felt like a little kid on Christmas 
morning using my software tool." Everyone in fund info was my test bed in 
San Mateo, California and it soon spread to Dealer Services and then across 
all Franklin sites in the US. I sent the link to Schwab in San Francisco
and after five interviews they hired me.

Charles Schwab Web Developer in San Francisco, California 2000 - 2001
I was a staff web developer in Electronic Brokerage Trading in San Francisco
at Charles Schwab.  After three months in San Francisco I was sent to Tokyo,
Japan for the summer to oversee the successful implimentation of the Goal Calculator project
for Charles Schwab Tokyo Marine Securities which was coded in Perl. My job was
to take their ten foot wide formula into a web app in JavaScript and HTML 
which I did in a weekend so the director to play what if. She used it and acted
like a kid in a toy store. I was also sent to Tokyo to examine all of their code
which was coded in Australia but I never was allowed to see the code. They had
other plans. They had me build an employee database that worked in Japanese
in English and dealt with multiple duplcate names.  To save time I reengineered
the BMW database engine I built at Franklin Templeton and turned it into a people
database instead of financial information database. Japanese keyboards don't have
backslash key on their keyboards so the code wouldn't run. So on the flight
back to San Francisco I recoded a working implimentation. My boss wrote me soon
afterwards from Tokyo. "Thank you, you are a professional software engineer."

I built more than 50 html web app front ends from specs
and increasingly wrote more JavaScript including making front end prototypes
of future Java apps in JavaScript. I did a side project to simplify my job
to speed up development called Entering The Forebidden City. This tool was
a database and search engine to search for and reuse chunks of my previous code
that did a described behavior. I code named it "Juggler" and was able to build
a new JavaScript program in a day that previously would have taken a month hand
coding.

JavaScript, Python, HTML, Dynamic HTML

Each programming language has new features and obvious undersights.
Python lacks C style macros, switch case, goto label, do while,
and curly braces to name a few.

I'm a huge fan of JavaScript and like the superpowers that C offers
so I recently designed and implimented a preprocessor for Python3
to enable the unimanginable: macros, switch, gotos, do while, and
lovely curly braces.

I started this project a year ago after making a rudimentary switch
case implimentation with ifs, elifs, elses in Python in Pydev.
This project seemed approachable at first and then grew exponentially.



Current project implimenting my design for a C style and behavior
switch case for Python 3. This is implimented inside regular Python
code inside of a docstring as a multiline variable. It runs inside
of normal function code because Python can't see it. It has the input
variable flow into it from above in the static code and has output
like a normal if elif else implimentation, but also engineered a
hash table dictionary implimentation for greater speed.

Based on the IBM/360 project methodology the system has been built in 
phased stages. As soon as the switch began working I implimented using
multiple switch cases in a cresendo feeding into each other and then
implimented making a switch module so a user could merely use:
import switch_module    and then start using it.

Like all projects it morphed and evolved into several facets and great
depth. The design was the key which was modular to control the complexity.
I designed on poster board to view it in a big view to visualize the structure.
I made the initial switch case that dealt with words and then added numbers.
The design is based on the Yale University notes on C to perfectly duplicate
the look and feel of an ANSI C switch case. 




clever('snoopy was flying') #this would change varholder[0]

# this idea came from PHP and it's actually the function
# that triggers the switch which is fed data utilizing a list above the switch
# that for testing uses the function clever (for now)
# I did the inditial development in PyDev on eclipse but it was too slow
# so I switched to Sublime Text and BBEdit
