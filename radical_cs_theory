My theory suggests a novel approach to programming by abstracting away direct communication with 
computers and instead utilizing a design interface program to interact with ChatGPT in English. 
This approach aims to describe a function's dynamic behavior in a human-readable manner, using 
structured pseudocode that is designed with verbs and provides more flexibility.

The generated code operates in pseudocode, ensuring readability, and utilizes methods 
and macros to execute tasks. This structured pseudocode converts to a method sequence, 
offering neatly organized solutions that define the internal behavior of functions
and facilitate the desired dynamic behavior. By structuring the code in this way, 
it encourages reuse and minimizes cognitive load. Additionally, a pseudocode debugger
would aid in identifying and resolving issues during development.

Overall, this approach proposes a shift towards more intuitive and reusable programming
practices, leveraging natural language communication and structured pseudocode to
streamline the development process and enhance dynamic behavior comprehension.
