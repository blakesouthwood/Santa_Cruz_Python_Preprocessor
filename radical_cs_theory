Theory For Faster Software Design and Development With A Design Tool

The idea is going backward. Instead of telling the dumb computer how to create a behavior function in
a programming language like Python we completely bypass the computer and  programming language
and instead, go through the design level that has abstraction levels and can have encased human thinking
which is based on the Turing lecture by Dijkstra. The computer's inability to learn and dumbness and the
cryptic confusing nature of the programming language are both bottlenecks that this approach bypasses.
This theory is based on Goldratt's The Theory of Constraints to increase throughput by eliminating the 
bottlenecks.

There will be naysayers so I had a conversation with Chat GPT for the past two weeks. I have included today's
conversation for you to read and digest the possibilities.
